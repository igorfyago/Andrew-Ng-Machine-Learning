1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.820
Another camera, and you're fine.

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.360
>> I don't know.
>> Is it working?

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.870
>> Is it working?

4
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.130
>> It's working.
>> Are you selfieing?

5
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.410
>> Yeah, this is my selfie cam.

6
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.640
My Gimbal selfie cam.

7
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.500
>> It works great.

8
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.380
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.640
So this way,
I can tape my meeting of Allen Downey.

10
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.520
>> Sweet.

11
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.400
>> That's gonna be sweet.

12
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.300
>> The moments.

13
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.580
>> The moment that I meet Allen.

14
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.820
>> That's how helpful.

15
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.320
>> It is.

16
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.000
>> Very cool indeed actually.

17
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.281
[LAUGH]
>> Folks,

18
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:31.980
that's Allen Downey,
who started the whole Think Java,

19
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.000
Think Python, revolution back 1999 and
I'm gonna meet him now.

20
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.410
For the first time.

21
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.199
>> And you can ask him that question, that
I should have asked him a long time ago.

22
00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:54.199
Right?

23
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:01.540
>> So what are your thoughts, Jeff?

24
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.084
Right before we meet
the great Allen Downey?

25
00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:03.656
>> I'm excited, I'm excited, I'm excited.
>> Okay.

26
00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:05.496
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's very exciting, but

27
00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:07.070
you've met Allen before.

28
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.840
>> I have, I have.
>> This is my first time.

29
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.180
>> But it's always exciting.

30
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.139
>> Exactly
>> [LAUGH

31
00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.226
>> Hi.

32
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:23.901
>> It's Allen Downey.

33
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.062
>> [LAUGH]
>> I'm Charles Severance.

34
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:25.804
>> Charles, it's great to see you.

35
00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:26.500
>> We're co-authors.

36
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.935
>> Yes.
>> We've never met in person.

37
00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.195
We talked on the phone.

38
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:31.235
This is the famous Jeff Elkner of course.

39
00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:32.515
>> I'm thrilled.
Jeff, it's nice to meet you.

40
00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:33.660
>> Made famous by this guy.

41
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.255
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, well we all,
everybody got made famous.

42
00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:37.045
>> That's right.

43
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.105
>> So
the first question I was asking Jeff, and

44
00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:40.930
he doesn't even know the answer to.

45
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.120
Is why did you choose GFDL back in 1999?

46
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.510
That was before creative commons,
before OCW.

47
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.790
Before everything.

48
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.770
>> Yeah.
>> What possessed you?

49
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.160
>> You know actually the first version of
the book I put it under the Gnu three.

50
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.970
>> GFDL?

51
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.100
>> No, not.

52
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.160
>> GPL
>> The GPL.

53
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.060
>> Oh, you did GPL?

54
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.830
>> Because I didn't even
know about the FTL.

55
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.350
>> And
then somebody got a hold of you from MIT.

56
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.680
>> And they said, wait a minute,
this is documentation, this is not code.

57
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.640
You should have used this other
license and so I switched.

58
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.130
And then when Creative Commons came along,
some of those licenses have been useful.

59
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.900
>> Yep.
>> Actually part of the reason that

60
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.070
working with O'Reilly has
worked out very well.

61
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.870
>> Yeah.
>> I do things usually under

62
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.060
a non commercial
>> Yeah.

63
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.220
>> Creative Commons license.

64
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.758
And then that's kind of a compromise.

65
00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:25.724
>> Yep.
>> It's maybe not ideal.

66
00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:28.367
>> But
those are the details the why questions.

67
00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:29.079
>> No the non-commercial's I think

68
00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:29.634
a beautiful thing
>> Yeah.

69
00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:32.987
>> And actually Creative Commons is
thinking about getting rid of it.

70
00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:36.394
I'm sad about that, because I think
it's a fine middle ground, for

71
00:02:36.394 --> 00:02:39.950
e-copies can be delivered free and
no one feels bad about that.

72
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.580
Print copies you make money off of so
it's pretty cool.

73
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.140
>> I agree.

74
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.960
I think there's a nice huge case for it.

75
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.140
>> So have you ever tried to count
the number of derivative books

76
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.480
of Think Python?

77
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.960
>> No.
>> Do you think it's 100, 200, 300?

78
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.760
>> I don't think it's 100.
>> How

79
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.600
to think like a computer scientist,
Java version.

80
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.340
The original.

81
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.260
>> If you go all the way back.

82
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.180
Yeah, all the way.

83
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.940
>> Java's the original.

84
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.460
There are a number of English language
books that are modified versions.

85
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.970
>> Including mine.

86
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.530
>> There are also- yep.
>> We need to get that data.

87
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.230
>> There are translations
into other languages.

88
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.837
>> I count those as separate ones.

89
00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:15.456
>> Yep.
>> But

90
00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.195
like Runestone like Brad Miller's stuff.

91
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.832
>> But then there's the interactive one.

92
00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.659
>> The interactive ones, yes.

93
00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:20.160
>> And then his book now.

94
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.430
>> Do you have an interactive version?

95
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.970
>> No, no, no, I just have the Python for
Informatics print and e-version.

96
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.620
>> Yeah, but that's been out for a while.

97
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.570
>> Yeah.

98
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.860
>> I did that many years ago.

99
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.900
And then I fought with Cambridge Press,
remember that?

100
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.710
>> Yes.
>> Remember those calls?

101
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.940
So but why did you give it away?

102
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.970
I mean it wasn't so
cool in 1999 just to give books away.

103
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.425
It was not normal.

104
00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.120
>> True, no.

105
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.880
>> That's the question I had.

106
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.510
>> Can we pause?

107
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.420
I do wanna, I wanna finish
signing books so these folks are-

108
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.460
>> Okay, so we'll have to talk later.

109
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.019
>> Okay, okay, we'll get back to this.

110
00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:54.750
>> Let's talk more.
