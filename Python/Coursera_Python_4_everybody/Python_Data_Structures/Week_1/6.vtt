2
00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:31.522
Good students get a better understanding
of something if they know the history of it.

3
00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.210
If they know where, if they know
where it's come from.

4
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.290
That's my, my view.

5
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.790
So when I go to class, andI go to the
interface design class, for instance, I

6
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.590
can take them down to the museum and show
them what an early interface was.

7
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.720
We, we talk about interface design,
and they think

8
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.830
of their, their hand-held computer, their
laptop, their desktop.

9
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.050
And they look at the screen and they think
that's we have, that's an

10
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.470
interface, and sure it is but where, you
know, how did we get there?

11
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.270
What was the early interface with
computers?

12
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700
And I take them down to the
Ferranti Sirius and

13
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.720
they say, well, what's the interface here
with the computer.

14
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.160
So it's, it's giving them the idea of what
an interface is by, by taking them back to

15
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.180
something that's that looks very primitive
and, and then

16
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.790
we look at the evolution of interfaces
over time.

17
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.718
We look at the different applications,
you know,

18
00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:25.470
we go back and look at VisiCalc and

19
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.960
WordStar and things like that and
sort of progress

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.040
through the different versions of these
different products and

21
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.625
>> You actually have like running
VisiCalc?

22
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.615
>> No, no we don't [CROSSTALK]

23
00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:44.840
but I think it just broadens their
outlook on IT and

24
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.180
I think it's a danger with computing
students that they become very,

25
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.140
become very focused on the latest,
and quickly discard the

26
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.410
technology they're using when the
next one comes along and forget about it.

27
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.340
>> Even before we had the museum we were

28
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.780
lucky, we had the CSIRAC, I've
mentioned CSIRAC to you.

29
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.935
The world's number four digital stored
program computer was left over, used till

30
00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:16.470
about' 65 So about' 72 or so it arrived
on campus just for storage purposes.

31
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.960
But we put it in a display area.

32
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.570
When I first arrived and my teaching 
here in

33
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.030
about '88 I began to teach. And I
would always take my

34
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.310
introduction to computer architecture
students past it, it had so

35
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.900
much to tell students about the origin
of operating systems

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.990
the primary function of operating systems 

37
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.130
to allocate resources and move  

38
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.800
the efficiency of use of resources.

39
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.110
>> With the programming students I can
show

40
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.860
them things like punch cards and things
like this.

41
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.250
You know, how did we get information into

42
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.730
the computers and show them things like
that.

43
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.465
So it might be part of one class in a
semester,

44
00:02:55.465 --> 00:03:00.770
using the museum in particular for my classes.

45
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.500
And others use it too in a similar way.

46
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.020
But we do have school children coming on
visits and then we have about an hour or

47
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.430
two and we take them through the museum
starting with the calculating machines.

48
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.520
And we talk about what what did people

49
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.070
do before computers, and about
things like this.

50
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.960
What is a computer?

51
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.148
Where did we get the name computing from?

52
00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:28.820
And I've got this picture of women using
slide rules in 1948,I think it was,

53
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.300
in, this is in America,
doing their calculations.

54
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.490
And the idea that the first computers were
people, okay, and, and

55
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.930
often they were women, so that's kind of
an interesting bit of social history there.

56
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
So trying to connect the computers
and state of the

57
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.410
technology to what was happening in
society at the time.

58
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.885
>> The physical aspects that are
important today.

59
00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:57.840
That idea of physical is still carried
forward even today as we're looking

60
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.190
to see what we can do with the full museum
that we've created now.

61
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.090
We've toyed with ideas of a web-based series
of exhibitions, photographing all of

62
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.770
the artifacts, and making sure that people

63
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.040
can sort of browse through, and
move through halls.

64
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.660
We feel that even with that web-based
teaching methods,

65
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.750
we would still like to have physical
artifacts, we've toyed with

66
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.960
a box of artifacts that we would
send out to

67
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.760
schools that are working on our program,
doing an educational program.

68
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.660
So, the physical hands-on is a very
important thing.

69
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.170
Museum curators understand it.

70
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.400
People who aren't museum curators
tend not to.

71
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.020
>> We had a, a staff member in our,
in our school.

72
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.360
When we started the museum, I was
talking to her

73
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.590
and, and said oh, we will have
slide rules in it.

74
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.520
Now she had done an honors
degree in maths.

75
00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.890
And she had not heard, she not that she

76
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.760
hadn't seen a slide rule, she didn't even
know what one was and that, to me, was

77
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.880
amazing because when I went to uni,
everyone carried a slide rule, you know.

78
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.910
We all had [LAUGH] this is my slide rule
from my university.

79
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.140
We all had these, as science students,
engineering students,

80
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.430
we all had these tools, and she was

81
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.350
probably ten years younger than me,
and suddenly

82
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.770
had no idea what I was even talking about.

83
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.870
Haven't heard the word. So I think that
really made me

84
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.072
realize that history is so quickly
forgotten and it is

85
00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:43.376
a danger that we just, yeah, we
forget about these things,

86
00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:48.170
and if we don't have them around for
people to see, they

87
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.066
forget about the history of the
technology that they're

88
00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:56.618
using and I think that's a real danger.

89
00:05:56.618 --> 00:06:06.618
