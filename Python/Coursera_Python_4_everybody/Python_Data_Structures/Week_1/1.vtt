00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.020
Hello and welcome to my class
on Python data structures.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.630
This is the second class in
our Python specialization.

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.095
It covers chapters six
through ten of the textbook.

4
00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.460
The previous class covered
chapters one through five.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.820
This is the last class in
the specialization that you can

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.050
avoid installing Python.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.270
All along we've encouraged
you to install Python.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.540
Do all your homework on your
desktop or laptop,

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.810
and then use our autograder
to turn things in.

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.580
But starting with the next class,
not this class, but

11
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.240
starting with the next class you're
going to have to install Python.

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.580
Because the programs get more complex.

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.220
We're using advanced Python features
that I can't simulate in a browser.

14
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.890
And so, I would say this is the time
to go ahead and install Python.

15
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.950
Especially if you want to go on
beyond chapter ten in the book.

16
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.310
So, if you are jumping into this class
and you find yourself struggling,

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.410
like whoa, I'm picking this
up in the middle, go back and

18
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.990
take the previous class.

19
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.480
We just assume that you have
mastered the previous class.

20
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.630
One of my whole goals in
design of this class, is for

21
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.990
you not to try to rush through it,
but to feel a mastery of it.

22
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.590
And feel free to do the same problem
over and over and over again,

23
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.440
and hide the solution from yourself,
until you realize, oh wait a sec.

24
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.360
This is easy. Because frankly,
up to this point and

25
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.355
going forward,
none of this should be very difficult.

26
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:25.890
And you should really understand
every single thing that's going on in

27
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.880
every one of the assignments.

28
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.432
Especially in the first
ten chapters of the book.

29
00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:33.330
Later the programs become a little more
complex and even by the end of the book,

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.640
in chapter 14 and 15.

31
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.410
It takes me hours to
write these applications.

32
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.320
And so, but here in chapters one
through ten, it doesn't take me hours.

33
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.570
It should take me, you know, five to
ten minutes at the most.

34
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.620
And it eventually should take you
five to ten minutes at the most.

35
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.180
So, welcome to the class.

36
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.220
I look forward to seeing you and
congratulations on getting this far

37
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.210
if you made it through the first class
