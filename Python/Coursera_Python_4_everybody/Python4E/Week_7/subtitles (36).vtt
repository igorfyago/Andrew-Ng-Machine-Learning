2
00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:16.524
Python was created by
Guido van Rossum in 1989

3
00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.610
while working at CWI in the Netherlands.

4
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.850
Python was released as
Open Source in February. 1991.

5
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.080
The open source community
grew around the world.

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.243
And the first Python workshop
was hosted by NIST in 1994.

7
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:40.583
>> From 95 to 2000, I worked in the U.S.
in Northern Virginia at CNRI.

8
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.130
And so, there we worked through
a lot of growth of the community and

9
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.190
the infrastructure.

10
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.490
We created the Python website.

11
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.190
I think when I started there,
Python 1.3 was about to be released.

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.450
And then while I was there,

13
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.210
we released several subsequent
versions leading up to 1.5.2.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.125
Which for some reason,

15
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:11.080
1.5.0 was nothing, but
1.5.2 remained the sort of,

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.958
the standard, the gold standard of Python
for a very long time afterwards.

17
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:22.070
Disagreement was brewing between
the people working on Python at CNRI and

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.070
the CNRI leadership about open source.

19
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.980
I was sort of courted by
a small no name startup,

20
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.530
and they said, oh,
you gotta come work for us.

21
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.490
We're an open source startup.

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.210
We're going to build an
open source portal.

23
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.388
And find a number of other
good Python engineers, and

24
00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:54.810
we'll give you all the time you want
to sort of work on Python full time.

25
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.050
And I thought, wow, that sounds great!

26
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.970
Especially, given that I
already had this sort of

27
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.830
discontent at the place where I
had been for five years, and so,

28
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.430
reluctantly, I agreed to join these guys.

29
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.310
Well, by then, by the time we
actually started, it was 2000.

30
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.380
And with, our start date was May 15,
the bubble had actually already burst.

31
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.940
I wasn't even aware that there was
a bubble and that it had burst.

32
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.900
I was in Northern Virginia
doing open source software.

33
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.450
I wasn't, I didn't really know
what a startup was.

34
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.680
I didn't really know how to tell whether
these people were trustworthy or not.

35
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.670
Well, we spent the summer in blissful
ignorance working full time on Python.

36
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.350
We built and released Python 2,
which was a big deal.

37
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.560
It contained Unicode.

38
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.079
We also,
because we had to have some kind of

39
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.250
graceful exit from my previous employer,

40
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.710
who claimed a certain amount of
ownership over the source code.

41
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:15.315
They didn't claim that it was all theirs,
because it wasn't theirs to begin with.

42
00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:20.065
It was open source before I joined, which
was an incredibly lucky circumstance.

43
00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.315
But, nevertheless, they sort of claimed

44
00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:28.005
ownership over what had been added to it
over the five years I worked there and

45
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.906
other people who were also employed there,
also worked there.

46
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:37.962
And so, with negotiations
facilitated by Eric Raymond,

47
00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:43.146
and I think also even
more in the background

48
00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:48.043
Eben Moglen, the free software lawyer,

49
00:03:48.043 --> 00:03:56.733
we negotiated some way to make sure
that Python remained open source,

50
00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:03.537
with a license that CNRI's
lawyers were agreeable to.

51
00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:07.060
And that was sort of,
Python still has a very awkward license.

52
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.130
And the history of that awkward
license lies in the way I left CNRI.

53
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.380
So, this little startup,
we didn't even move to the west coast.

54
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.903
We just sort of, we worked from our homes.

55
00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:26.341
And I remember that once a week,
we had a team meeting and

56
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:31.549
a catch-up with the leadership
in California in my living room.

57
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.490
And within five months, it was over.

58
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.750
They suddenly stopped paying us.

59
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.310
And those five months,

60
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.300
we had had the time of our lives working
on Python, doing this Python 2 release.

61
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.998
We also had to do a Python 1.6 release,

62
00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:58.580
that was actually nearly
identical to Python 2.0.

63
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.530
That was the first Python 1.0
release with CNRI's license on it.

64
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.344
And sort of over the summer and
the fall of 2000,

65
00:05:08.344 --> 00:05:13.730
this startup company began to show
more and more signs of dysfunction.

66
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.710
Other teams suddenly disappeared.

67
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.740
We later heard that they had been fired.

68
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.420
They flew us out to the west
coast to talk to random

69
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.570
potential customers,
to sort of show off our technical prowess

70
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.910
and somehow, get some kind of deal
where we would do work for a customer.

71
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.790
None of those deals ever closed.

72
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.850
So they were going deeper and
deeper in the hole.

73
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.900
And at the end of the year,
the investors decided to stop funding it.

74
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.815
And then suddenly, we were like,
we were out in the streets.

75
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.220
We were relatively well off,
because we had been paid well until then.

76
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.410
But, yeah, the company was gone.

77
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.450
So, what, all we got out of it was,
they had given each of us,

78
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.880
they had bought each of us a good
computer to work from home.

79
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.035
So, that was our last payment.

80
00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:21.740
[LAUGH] Cuz we talked to lawyers or

81
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.320
somehow we got advice where someone said,
yeah, sure.

82
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.450
Just hold onto that equipment.

83
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.750
Nobody's going to have the power
to take that away from you.

84
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.970
They're not going to go after you.

85
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.940
And so, then there was actually,
well I wouldn't call it a bidding war.

86
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.230
But we were negotiating
with both Active State,

87
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.160
which was a small software company
in Vancouver, and Zope Corporation,

88
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.400
which was a small Python-exclusive
software company in Northern Virginia.

89
00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.008
And the whole Python labs team,
five of us, ended up working for Zope.

90
00:07:00.008 --> 00:07:07.680
And that was an incredibly lucky rescue.

91
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.100
>> With the terms and conditions that
pretty much keep working on Python, right?

92
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.430
I mean, that
Zope didn't tell you you had to go-

93
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.110
>> No, Zope was very clear.

94
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:24.750
They said, we have no design on
the ownership of that software.

95
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.590
We want you guys,
you guys are really good programmers.

96
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.910
You guys are the top of
the Python community.

97
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.120
You are going to get some time and

98
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.880
it wasn't stated very
precisely how much time.

99
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.980
And we were fine with that at the time.

100
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.660
We realized that what we had done for

101
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.510
this failing startup was not
actually a realistic option.

102
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:55.000
That they would just pay our salaries and
we would only do open source development.

103
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.020
Nobody could maintain that, so
we had sort of grown up quickly.

104
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.238
We did continue to do a lot of

105
00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:06.290
sort of fundamental Python
work at the time at Zope.

106
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.350
We also did a lot of
fundamental Zope work.

107
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.470
Over time, sort of, the team dispersed.

108
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.620
I got a job offer to come work for
a small startup again in California.

109
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.090
This time I did my
homework a little better.

110
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:31.250
Python just kept, sort of, growing, and
the community kept self-organizing.

111
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.970
And so, what started out as
a workshop we had with about 20,

112
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.640
25 people at most attending in '94.

113
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.680
Within a few years,
we had an annual, what we called

114
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:51.280
the International Python Conference, with
with three or four hundred people attending.

115
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.088
I always encouraged
the community to self-organize

116
00:08:56.088 --> 00:09:00.520
rather than sort of looking at me for
every decision.

117
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.660
And so,
one of the things that gradually appeared

118
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.200
was the notion of Python warts.

119
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.030
I'm not sure, but I think that Andrew
Kuchling was actually one of the first

120
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:23.500
to talk about Python warts, and sort of
blog about it or give a talk about it.

121
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.040
Of course, different people have different
ideas about what's wrong with Python.

122
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.360
But, sort of the idea of
warts is things that keep

123
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.850
tripping people up over and over.

124
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:41.420
And so, there is at least some notion of,
these are objectively problems.

125
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.354
Every sort of feature release,
2.1, 2.2, 2.3.

126
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:51.380
We tried to fix some of these things.

127
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:59.440
But we also came up against a wall of
things that we could never fix because

128
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.290
the fix was sort of, required changing
the language in an incompatible way.

129
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.620
Because it's always
easy to add new syntax,

130
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.200
that sort of doesn't get in
the way of existing syntax.

131
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.110
But it's very hard to
take away a particular

132
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.970
syntactic construct that has
an unfortunate but well-defined meaning.

133
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.452
And all these things built up and,
sort of,

134
00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:31.880
in the middle of the first
decade of the new century,

135
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.100
this idea of Python 3000 was born.

136
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.610
Like, okay,

137
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.150
we have so many things that we
would like to fix.

138
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.960
We know roughly how to fix them,
but the fix would be incompatible.

139
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.870
Let's create a new version of
the language that fixes a whole bunch

140
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.870
of those things together.

141
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.350
While at the same time, not making
the new version of the language so

142
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.920
different that it alienates the users.

143
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.980
Every year at PyCon,
I sort of take the census of well,

144
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.440
who is using Python 3 and
how committed are they?

145
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.710
And how happy are they?

146
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.500
And sort of,
are there users actually using Python 3?

147
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.860
And, I see tremendous
progress there every year.

148
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.000
But, we're still not, we're not in,
sort of, where we finally want to be.

149
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.690
I mean, at the last PyCon conference,
I had to, sort of, hold off a whole bunch

150
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:43.500
of people with very good arguments of
why we should do a Python 2.8 release.

151
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.556
And so, Python 3 is winning the race.

152
00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:52.160
But it will, the race hasn't been run yet.

153
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.723
We're still in the race.

154
00:11:54.723 --> 00:11:57.811
It's clear that Python
3 is going to win it.

155
00:11:57.811 --> 00:12:07.811
