00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:13.384
Hello, Chuck here.

3
00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.594
We are here in Paris France with yet
another face to face office hours for

4
00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:22.320
Coursera, and I'd like you to meet
some of your fellow students.

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.110
So, say hi and say your first name and if
you wanna say hi in French, go ahead and

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.350
say hi in French or say hi in English.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.334
>> Hi
>> Bonjour.

8
00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:31.958
Seymour.

9
00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.020
>> Hi.
Sydney.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.650
>> Hi, I'm Alex.

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.310
>> Hi, I'm Julian.

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.380
>> Okay, there you go.

13
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.040
Yet another successful office hours.

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.400
In a bit I will hop on a plane and
go to Milan.

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.150
This is called the fashion
tour of Paris and Milan,

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.050
except that I don't have the clothes for
that.

17
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.460
But, we'll see you soon in Milan.

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.960
Bye.
