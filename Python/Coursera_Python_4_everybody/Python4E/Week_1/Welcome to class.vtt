00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.102
Hello, and welcome to my Programming for
Everybody course on Coursera.

2
00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:07.510
My name's Charles Severance and
I'm a Clinical Associate Professor in

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.450
the University of
Michigan School of Information.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.410
I'm convinced that anyone
can learn to program, and

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.950
I've built a course that introduces
you to the basics of programming.

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.930
You don't need to be a math expert.
If you can add, subtract, multiply,

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.120
and divide numbers,

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.200
you are ready to take this class.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.400
But I don't just want to teach you
the Python programming language.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.540
I have a few other goals.

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.800
First, I'd like to teach you how
to take a programming class.

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.235
There are lots of wonderful resources
like Khan Academy and Code Academy and

13
00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:43.180
code.org on the web that can teach
you bits and pieces of programming.

14
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.240
Perhaps you've even started to learn
programming using Scratch or Minecraft.

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.080
But learning on your own
will only get you so far.

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.320
And programming classes
can be challenging.

17
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.520
So I want you to develop skills
in taking programming classes,

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.010
so that you can successfully take other
courses, like those from Rice University,

19
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.090
the University of Washington, or others.

20
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.040
My second goal is teach you how to mentor
others, to help them learn programming.

21
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900
Because if we're truly going to
achieve programming for everybody,

22
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.910
we need lots of mentors.

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.940
Even in this class,

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.480
you will learn a great deal from the other
students and Community Teaching Assistants.

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.390
And one-to-one interaction
is really important.

26
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.740
Especially when learning complex
skills like programming.

27
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.670
My third goal is to give everyone
a kit of free and open materials so

28
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.850
that anyone who's a teacher can teach
a version of this class locally.

29
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.740
All the materials in this course
are available under a Creative

30
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.220
Commons license.

31
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.340
The book is free.

32
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.990
The PowerPoint files are free.

33
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.040
The video and audio materials are free.

34
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.820
And the autograder that I
use in class is also free.

35
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.350
I provide you a link to
our Open Michigan website

36
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.580
where you can download all
the materials for the class.

37
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.500
I firmly believe that beginning classes
need to be taught in one's native

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000
language, so I want to encourage teachers
around the world to take my materials,

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
translate them, remix them, and republish
them with a Creative Commons license.

40
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.310
I would like to see the textbook for

41
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.280
the course also made available in
many different languages as well.

42
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.070
To sum this all up, I see Programming for

43
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.270
Everybody as much more than a single
class, I want this to become a movement

44
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.780
that creates an expanding open ecosystem
that brings us all closer together.

45
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.170
And helps us move towards a world where
programming is truly for everybody.

46
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.690
See you in class.
