1
00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:14.297
[SOUND] So now we're going to talk
about Python as a programming language.

2
00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.580
You probably noticed that
I'm wearing a sorting hat.

3
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.610
The reason I'm wearing a sorting hat
is that where I work at the University

4
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.710
of Michigan School of Information, we
are in a building called the North Quad.

5
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.913
And you can look it up on Google and
find a picture of it if you like.

6
00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:34.990
And I think it's designed
to be like Hogwarts.

7
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.130
It's got a little center,
it's got this outside bit,

8
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.040
it's got a really cool cafeteria that
looks like owls might fly through it.

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.700
And so we moved to this a few years
back when I started teaching Python.

10
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.054
And I was teaching my very,
very first class in this building,

11
00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:57.235
which we've sort of lovingly called
Quadwarts, because it's North Quad and

12
00:00:57.235 --> 00:00:59.407
we thought it was kind of like Hogwarts.

13
00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:04.548
And so, I'm joking, and
I wore my robes to class, and

14
00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:09.928
I said welcome to Quadwarts,
and you have to wear your

15
00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:14.969
robes every time to class,
and I was being funny.

16
00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.438
And I said okay, it's our first class,
we're teaching Python, and

17
00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:21.620
let's do a sorting ceremony.

18
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.030
I didn't have the sorting hat back then,
so I have a sorting hat now.

19
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.080
And so, that's cool.

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.190
And I'm like,
I think I'm going to be in Gryffindor.

21
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.370
And they told me, the students said
that I couldn't be in Gryffindor.

22
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
And I'm like,
why can't I be in Gryffindor?

23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.320
Everybody wants to be in Gryffindor.

24
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.800
And they told me that
I was teaching Python.

25
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.880
Python is like a programming
language that's based on a snake.

26
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.430
And even worse, my name's Charles
Severance, and I'm like Severus Snape.

27
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.300
And so they basically told me
that I had to be in Slytherin.

28
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.220
And so since then, I've bought many
Slytherin items, I got Slytherin wands,

29
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.758
when I graduate,
you'll see my Slytherin wand.

30
00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:09.400
I got a sorting hat, so you'll see me
drinking tea throughout the class,

31
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.630
from my Slytherin cup and so I guess
I'm just doomed to be in Slytherin.

32
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't know if that means I'm a good guy
or a bad guy, or a good guy that seems

33
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.020
like a bad guy or bad guy that turns
out to be a, right, it's a lot of book.

34
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.150
So, the whole thing about being in
Slytherin is that you can talk to snakes

35
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.840
because you can talk this weird
language that others don't understand.

36
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.530
Python's like that.

37
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.590
Python's a language that
most don't understand.

38
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.070
You, of course,
will begin to understand it.

39
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.610
It's a weird language, it's strange,
it's not easily understood by others.

40
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.200
We call ourselves Pythonistas.

41
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.340
And Guido van Rossum, over 20 years ago,
invented this Python language

42
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.290
that we have grown to know and
love, and has become so important.

43
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.210
And while I'm going through
all this like snake stuff,

44
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.840
it turns out that that is not at
all why Python was named Python.

45
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.150
Python was not named for

46
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.910
a snake even though we use
the snake motif all the time.

47
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.270
It turns out that what Python was named
for was Monty Python's Flying Circus.

48
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.930
And the reason was is that Guido was
trying to capture an air of play.

49
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.100
Most programming languages in the 80s
when Python started were very,

50
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.870
very serious, and very complex and you had
to be really serious to figure them out,

51
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.194
a lot of math geniuses.

52
00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:38.300
And Guido thought, I could probably
write a programming language that

53
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.390
wouldn't be that hard,
would be fun actually,

54
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.180
would be enjoyable to use, but
let's not make it bad.

55
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.660
Let's not make it weak,
let's make it both powerful and enjoyable.

56
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.350
And so that's why Python turns
out to be such a perfect language

57
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.950
to use as your first programming language,
is that it's designed

58
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.330
to be your first programming language but
it's also powerful.

59
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.335
So many times you build a first
programming language that's weak.

60
00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.275
And not capable of doing a lot of stuff.

61
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:09.980
But Python has this wonderful,
easy to learn and powerful and useful.

62
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.910
And so there we are.

63
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.613
Welcome to being a Pythonista.

64
00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:20.026
Now. As you learn Python, remember,

65
00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:25.710
you're talking to a snake and this is
a language that you don't already know.

66
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.840
You are going to make lots of mistakes.

67
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.200
And the computer is going to seem
to judge your mistakes harshly.

68
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.810
You will learn the word
"syntax error" a lot.

69
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.080
And, if you're like me, I think back to
the first time that I was programming.

70
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.610
I was typing stuff on cards, and
you'd bring your card deck up and

71
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.740
you'd hand it to the computer.

72
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.480
And you'd read it through the computer.

73
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.500
And then the computer would come back and
say syntax error.

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.960
And sometimes it took several hours to
get back the results of your program.

75
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.151
You're going to get to do it in seconds,
but in the old days when I was young,

76
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.513
it took hours sometimes.

77
00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:05.199
And then all you get back
is a syntax error and

78
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.060
when I first started programming, I grew
to kind of hate the creature that lived

79
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.470
inside the computer because I
thought that the creature didn't like me.

80
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.370
I thought the creature was
value judging my programs.

81
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.528
I mean, I would write this thing and I
think it's perfect and I would hand it in.

82
00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:23.637
And the computer would say, syntax error.

83
00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:24.920
And I'm like, huh?

84
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.540
What's up, syntax error.

85
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.820
And then I would like, okay, I'll make
my program better and here you go.

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.160
And it would say syntax error again.

87
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.175
And the thing that you're going
to have to learn is that,

88
00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:42.230
syntax error doesn't mean that
Python thinks you're bad.

89
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.330
It is not a judgement of your
ability as a programmer,

90
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.640
it is not a judgement of your
potential to be a programmer.

91
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.330
Syntax error means Python is lost.

92
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.660
You are learning Python's language
because Python can't learn your language.

93
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.160
You're smarter than Python.

94
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.470
We can teach you.

95
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.255
You can learn, but Python can't.

96
00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:07.158
And so when it says syntax error, even
though you feel like it's a rejection,

97
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:10.750
syntax error simply means
that Python is lost.

98
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.220
It just doesn't have really friendly
words when it says it's lost,

99
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.950
it just goes syntax error, which
literally is exactly what's happening.

100
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.592
Your syntax is not something
that Python understands.

101
00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:29.347
So just understand as you go through
the next couple of weeks that you will be

102
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.260
frustrated.

103
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.880
It's not because you're a bad person,

104
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.400
it's not because you're never
going to figure it out.

105
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.520
You will figure it out and
you will get it.

106
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.160
And you have to sort of trust us as
we go through the first few weeks and

107
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.180
learn the basics.

108
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.080
And then as we connect
the basics together,

109
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.300
then this thing will
make a lot more sense.

110
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.000
I remember when I was first learning to
program, I would be like, lost, lost,

111
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.680
lost, lost, lost, oh wow, I love this.

112
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.020
And I expect that many of you will go
through that exact same feeling so

113
00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.840
you have to trust us.

114
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.080
So up next, we're going to actually talk
about the Python programming language.
