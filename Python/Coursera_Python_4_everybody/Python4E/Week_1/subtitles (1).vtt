00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:09.130
I'm Guido van Rossum.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.100
I created the Python language.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.800
I have worked on Python for 25 years and

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.150
I have worked with a large group of
others of course in the Python community.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.430
I'm very excited to see
you all in this class.

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.450
And I'm very proud that you're
using my language to learn.

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.400
Python is just the first step you're
setting on the path to programming.

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.530
There are many exciting things
to learn in programming.

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.230
Many that you can learn using Python, many
that you can learn using other things.

11
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.850
And you won't be alone.

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.196
There will be millions of people
who have gone before you or, or

13
00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.485
who are learning Python
at the same time as you.

14
00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:55.992
And you, you can help each other,
and you can learn together.
