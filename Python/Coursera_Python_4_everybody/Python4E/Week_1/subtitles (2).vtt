00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:11.010
Hello, and welcome to Python for
Everybody.

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
My name's Charles Severance and
I am your instructor.

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.760
We named this Python for Everybody because
we are dedicated to the notion that

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.780
increasingly as our lives
are surrounded by technology, that we

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.590
want you to become a maker of technology,
not just a consumer of technology.

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.890
We want to change your
perspective from this side

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.050
of technology where you are looking at it,
to the other side where you're back here.

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.840
You are like a creator of the technology
and you can create things.

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.620
And it takes a long time and you may not
want to be a professional programmer ever,

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.820
you might just like read
a little bit of data, but

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.890
we believe that everybody should
know basically how to program and

12
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.010
how to get things done inside of
a computer, just as much to just be

13
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.730
a responsible participant in a modern,
increasingly technically oriented society.

14
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.250
Computers want to be helpful.

15
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.510
They are programmed, they are designed,
the hardware's designed.

16
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.620
We'll talk about hardware
in the next segment.

17
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.100
But it's designed and wired, and
when you apply electricity to it,

18
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.530
it basically has one question, and
that is what do you want to do next?

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.990
And if you think about your phone and
all the apps that you have on your phone,

20
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.770
each app is like what to do next,
what to do next.

21
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.830
So, as a programmer,
your job is to serve the user.

22
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.370
The user has something they want to do.

23
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.410
Maybe they want to zing a bird towards
a pig or maybe they need to analyze some

24
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.250
data, or maybe they want to do
something like talk to their phone and

25
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.560
you have to be a real
advanced computer scientist.

26
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.160
And so, as a user we just have so
many wonderful programmers who have put so

27
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.740
much software that make
these phones intelligent.

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.670
The hardware itself is
not all that intelligent.

29
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.160
And our job as programmers is to act as
intermediaries between the hardware and

30
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.900
the user to build something wonderful and
beautiful.

31
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.850
And so, you can kind of imagine
that your job as a programmer

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.290
is to intermediate between
the hardware and the end user.

33
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.050
And if you're a professional programmer
and you're trying to sell your software,

34
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.370
well, you're trying to imagine
what the world might want.

35
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.800
And you could imagine all
these app stores, etc.

36
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.230
And these are places that
you can build software,

37
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.610
and exchange that software with
other folks, and help people out.

38
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.620
And like I said,
we are trying to flip you from

39
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.990
one side of this device to the other side
of this device, where you are the maker.

40
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.030
And you can think of this as
a tool to manage your calendar,

41
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.690
or drive your car and
read a map, or whatever.

42
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.310
But when you look at it
from the other side,

43
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.520
when you look at it from being
a programmer, you use things like

44
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.920
compilers and interpreters and programming
languages and networks, etc.

45
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.440
And we actually have tools that
we are going to learn to use.

46
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.930
Python is a tool that the programmers
on the back side of this computer

47
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.189
use to make new things for
the front side of the computer.

48
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.580
Now, what's your motivation
to become a programmer?

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.680
Well, the kind of gross motivation for

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.430
professional programmers is to build
something for everyone else to use.

51
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.560
Like I worked on this open
source software called Sakai,

52
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.340
which millions of people use around
the world, teaching and learning.

53
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.400
It's very rewarding for me.

54
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.210
I feel really good about that.

55
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.250
You might build a guest book for
a website.

56
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.570
But that's generally not the first
thing that you're going to do

57
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.150
with your programming skills.

58
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.210
You might get some data.

59
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.350
You might be an accountant.

60
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.630
Or you might be a lawyer.

61
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.270
Or you might be a librarian.

62
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.490
And somebody's got some data and
you can't get a report out of this data,

63
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.970
it's something you're
really curious about.

64
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.340
Somebody says can you knock out
a little piece of Python code

65
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.080
to count up the number of times
that this happens on Saturday, but

66
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.880
then it also happens again on Monday.

67
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.120
Tell us how many times that happens.

68
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.480
And so you write 40 lines of code and it
comes out and tells us what that data is.

69
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.640
And that's really useful.

70
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.080
The key difference between writing
a program for someone else and writing

71
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.640
a program kind of for yourself to consume
or just a few other people is the rigor.

72
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.610
You don't have to be such a professional

73
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.410
just to write code that
you can use yourself.

74
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.070
If it works and it gets you
the data you want, then job done.

75
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.080
If you want to become
a professional programmer,

76
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.870
then you kind of have to study how to
be more precise and more engineering.

77
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.130
But we're not going to worry about
that in this beginning set of courses.

78
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.230
We just want you to learn the mechanics
and the language of programming.

79
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.040
And so we kind of want to take you,
like I said,

80
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.700
from being a user to being a programmer.

81
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.060
And as a programmer, you start thinking
of yourself as living inside the computer.

82
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.820
So you're a consumer out here.

83
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.730
You're clicking on buttons and stuff.

84
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.700
And so as a programmer, you're going to
write code and that code is going to use

85
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.830
data, networks, and CPUs, and memory, and
then do something for the user.

86
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.000
So we're trying to change your perspective
and sort of pull you into the computer.

87
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.030
Well, what are you doing in that computer?

88
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.050
What's code?
What's software?

89
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.150
What's a program?

90
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.840
Well, a program is like a sequence
of stored instructions.

91
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.100
And the idea is that the computer itself at the
lowest level in the hardware is just not

92
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.120
that smart.

93
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.710
But it has a lot of flexibility in that
if we give it the right instructions,

94
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.860
it can do amazing things.

95
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.770
If we give it right instructions to
listen to voice, digitize the voice, and

96
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.980
make sense of the voice,

97
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.000
then you can write
a program that can "hear".

98
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.560
The computer doesn't hear,
the program hears.

99
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.650
The computer makes it so that it can run
all the calculations that seems to make it

100
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.530
hear, but a human being or
actually thousands of human beings

101
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.370
made it possible so
that you could talk to your phone.

102
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.310
And so you can think of, at the far end
of this, when you're building something

103
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.780
really brilliant like the ability for
a computer to listen to you,

104
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.080
you are taking you, and all your
creativity, and all the research that

105
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.860
you've done and you're building something
really amazing and put it in the computer.

106
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.680
But it is still a stored series of
instructions that runs step by step, and

107
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.950
someone figured out every single
little step that has to happen.

108
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.100
And so once we figured this out,

109
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.750
we write the instructions carefully and
then we give it to somebody.

110
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.950
Here is a program that
does voice recognition.

111
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.320
And if you're interested in it,
I say it's wonderfully creative.

112
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.710
As a professional programmer,
I have loved my life.

113
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.700
I have loved the kinds of things that
I do, that I build things for people.

114
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.720
And I make them happy, and
then I sort of feed off of that and

115
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.320
then I build something else.

116
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.260
But ultimately it's just
a set of instructions.

117
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.370
If you're like,
what's in a set of instructions?

118
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.010
Well, here we go.

119
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.670
Here is a program for a human being.

120
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.150
Now I may be showing my age a little bit,
but this is a YouTube video.

121
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.750
Hopefully, it's not taken down
by copyright or whatever.

122
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.700
On this song called the Macarena.

123
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.380
And so, the Macarena is an algorithm or
a series of steps that hopefully you,

124
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.920
five years ago or many years ago
you would got to the bar and

125
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.740
you'd watched all these
people doing these things.

126
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.870
Putting their hands up and putting their
stuff around, and wiggle, wiggle, wiggle,

127
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.180
and turning around, right?

128
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.250
And you're sitting there, 
and you're like okay,

129
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.080
what's the sequence of
instructions that you're doing?

130
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.410
As a matter of fact,
there's a looping thing.

131
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.260
As long as the music plays,
you put your left hand out,

132
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.140
you put your right hand out.

133
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.750
You flip your left hand.

134
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.950
Flip your left hand, flip your right hand.

135
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.150
I forgot all about it.

136
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.010
But, here's something I want you to do.

137
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.490
I want you to look at this slide.

138
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.700
Now, I'm going to be quiet for a minute.

139
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.060
I want you to look at this slide,
pause the video if necessary.

140
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.900
This, there are three
bugs in this program.

141
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.267
It looks right, but there are three bugs.

142
00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:34.289
So I'm going to stop for a second.

143
00:07:45.168 --> 00:07:47.130
So hopefully you paused, if you had to.

144
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.500
But now I'm going to come back and
I will show you what the bugs are.

145
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.330
And here are the three bugs.

146
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.610
Now if you didn't find them,
even if you looked closely,

147
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.760
you have learned something
about human beings and

148
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.210
that is that we human beings
operate in an error-filled world.

149
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.700
There are typographical errors,
people say things incorrectly.

150
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.820
And we as people just fix them as we're
perceiving them, as we understand them.

151
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.550
But even as you read this,
you might not have seen these mistakes,

152
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.330
because your brain just fixed them because
we just fix errors in our environment.

153
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.240
It's what we do.

154
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.960
Computers aren't like that,
they are not like that.

155
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.180
Although voice recognition,
after a while, that software

156
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.850
does learn how to filter out errors, but
that was really hard to write, okay?

157
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.500
Computers do not understand how to filter
out errors, but with enough instruction,

158
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.950
you can kind of get them
to filter out errors, okay?

159
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.730
And that's why search
engines kind of work,

160
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.910
they're, it's sort of a soft intelligence,
but it was really hard to build.

161
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.536
But when we start talking
about writing programs,

162
00:08:50.536 --> 00:08:53.346
whether it's writing programs
to do search engines or

163
00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:57.730
writing programs to do voice recognition,
those programs have to be perfect.

164
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.940
They make the tiniest text
contextual or typographical error.

165
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.250
those programs simply do not work.

166
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.110
And so, here we go.

167
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.580
So here we say right ham
to the back of the head.

168
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.500
What? Where was there ham in this?

169
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.820
So you got this ham in your hand, and
you went, hit in the back of your head.

170
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.406
You may not notice this, but

171
00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:22.540
the computer is literally going to say,
syntax error, I quit, right?

172
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.970
And so, syntax error is the moment
where the computer says to itself,

173
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.610
I don't know what to do.

174
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.590
And the same thing is true here.

175
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.300
I gotta hit somebody,
what are you talking about?

176
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.140
And so the computer is going to
be completely lost by this.

177
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.120
You might look at this and you might
just fix it and compensate for it.

178
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.600
So that's sort of a little set of
programming, programs for people.

179
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.310
So that's the code that's right.

180
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.340
So, let's talk a little bit
about programs in Python.

181
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.830
Like I said, it's a set of instructions.
So I'm want to put up some text here and

182
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.570
I want you to count the number
of each word in this text and

183
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.590
then tell me what's the most common word
is and how many times this word occurs.

184
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.627
Here we go.

185
00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:16.786
Count, just count, concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate,

186
00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:21.662
concentrate, and part of
the interesting thing here is not so

187
00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:25.599
much whether you can count those words or
not, but

188
00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:32.050
how your mind is actually reacting to
the problem that I just placed you in.

189
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.170
You're probably like, ooh,
this is just not good.

190
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.720
I'm so good, I can drive a car, I can
play baseball, I can catch something.

191
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.240
I can sing a song.

192
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.460
And yet to be focused on counting these
words seems really, really annoying.

193
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.570
It turns out this is one of those things,
text analysis, is one of those things

194
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.990
that computers are really good at and
we humans are really bad at.

195
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.000
So it's really great to delegate
this problem to a computer,

196
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.990
if you know the language of the computer
and you can talk to the computer.

197
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.730
And so,
I don't expect you to look at this code.

198
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.670
We're going to spend many weeks looking
at all the basics of this thing, but

199
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.880
this is a program.

200
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.120
This is a set of instructions, it's got
two, six, about 11, 12 lines of code.

201
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.590
And in it, we have instructed the computer
to read through a bunch of text,

202
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.660
count the words, and
tell us what the most common word is.

203
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.130
And so if we run this program,
and we give it a file of words,

204
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.690
it'll say the most common word is 
"to" and there's 16.

205
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.580
That clown.txt that I just asked you,
"the" is the most common word, and

206
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.718
there are seven of those.

207
00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:40.810
And so, this is a,

208
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.950
this is basically an outline of a program,
that, I mean,

209
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.130
it is a program that gets  
solves this problem that we will learn about.

210
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.610
So, don't try to learn this right away.

211
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.650
Up next, we're going to talk about
the hardware architecture and what goes on

212
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.960
inside the computer that you're going to
make use of as you become a programmer.
