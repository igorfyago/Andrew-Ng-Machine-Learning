1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.150
Camera and you're fine.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.360
Is it working?

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.060
>> It's working.

4
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.070
>> Are you selfie-ing?

5
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.410
>> Yeah, this is my selfie cam.

6
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.640
My Gimble selfie cam.

7
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.500
>> It works great.

8
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.380
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.640
So this way I can tape my
meeting of Allen Downey.

10
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.520
>> Sweet.

11
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.590
>> That's gonna be sweet.

12
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.300
>> Moments.

13
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.840
>> The moment that I meet Allen.

14
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.820
>> Palpable.

15
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.670
>> It is.
>> Very cool indeed, I'd say.

16
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
[LAUGH]
>> Folks.

17
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.300
That's Allen Downey, who started the whole
Think Java, Think Python revolution.

18
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.740
Back in 1999, and
I'm going to meet him now the first time.

19
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.880
>> You can ask him that question that I
should have asked him a long time ago.

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.222
>> [SOUND]

21
00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:06.949
So what are your thoughts, Jeff, before
we meet the great Allen Downey?

22
00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:07.665
>> But you've met Alan before?

23
00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:08.306
>> I have.

24
00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:09.003
>> This is my first time.

25
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.001
>> But it's always exciting.

26
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.207
>> Exactly.

27
00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:24.815
>> I'm Charles Severance.

28
00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:25.695
>> Charles, it's great to see you.

29
00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:26.705
>> We're co-authors.

30
00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:27.935
>> Yes?
>> We've never met in person.

31
00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.195
We talked on the phone.

32
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:31.215
This is the famous Jeff Elkner, of course.

33
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:34.045
>> Made famous by this guy.

34
00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.320
>> Well everybody got made famous.

35
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.995
>> [LAUGH]
>> So the first question I was asking Jeff

36
00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:43.120
and he doesn't even know the answer to
 is why did you choose GFDL back in 1999?

37
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.920
That was before Creative Commons,
before OCW, before everything.

38
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770
What possessed you?

39
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.440
>> You know,
actually the first version of the book,

40
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.970
I put it under the GNU Free
>> GFDL.

41
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.870
>> Not not-
>> GFDL.

42
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.060
The GPL.
>> Oh, you did the GPL.

43
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.830
>> Because I didn't even
know about the GFTL.

44
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.730
>> And then somebody got ahold of you,
from MIT.

45
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.220
>> And they said wait
 a minute, this is documentation, 
 this is not code.

46
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.640
You should use this other license,
and so I switched.

47
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.670
And then when Creative Commons came along,
some of those licenses has been useful.

48
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.080
Actually part of the reason that working
with O'Reilly has worked out very well.

49
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.770
I do things usually under a non-commercial 
Creative Commons license, and

50
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.070
then that's kind of a compromise.

51
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.180
>> Yeah.
>> So it's not ideal.

52
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.990
>> But those are the details, so why
>> Though the non-commmercial's

53
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.400
I think a beautiful thing.

54
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.205
Actually Creative Commons is thinking
about getting rid of it.

55
00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:33.270
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

56
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.290
>> And I'm sad about that, because I
think it is a fine middle ground.

57
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.950
E-copies can delivered free and
no one feels bad about that.

58
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.500
Print copies you make money off of.

59
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.580
So it's pretty cool.

60
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.960
>> I agree I think there's
a nice use case for it.

61
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.380
>> So have you ever tried to count
the number of derivative books

62
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.480
of Think Python?

63
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660
>> No.
>> Do you think it's 100?

64
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.940
200? 300? >> I don't think.

65
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.100
>> How to Think Like a Computer
Scientist Java version.

66
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.084
>> If you go all the way back.

67
00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:04.670
>> There are a number of English language

68
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.230
books that are modified versions.

69
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.280
>> Including mine.

70
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.230
>> There are translations into

71
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.800
>> I count those as separate ones.

72
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.990
>> Yep.
>> But

73
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.560
like Runestone, like Brad Miller's stuff,
>> Active more, I guess.

74
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.480
>> Do you have an interactive version?

75
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.005
>> No no I just have the Python for
Informatics print and e-version.

76
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.220
>> Yeah, that's
>> I did that many years ago, and

77
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.880
then I fought with Cambridge Press.

78
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.900
Remember that?

79
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.310
>> Yes.
>> Remember those calls?

80
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.220
Yeah.
So,

81
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.940
but that's, but like why did you give it away?

82
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.970
I mean, it wasn't so
cool in 1999 just to give books away.

83
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.580
It was not normal.

84
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.220
>> True.
No.

85
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.560
But that's the question that I wanted.

86
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.510
>> Can we pause?

87
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.140
I do want to,
I want to finish signing books

88
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.820
>> So we have to talk later.

89
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.775
>> Okay, we'll get back to this.

90
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:55.275
>> [LAUGH]
