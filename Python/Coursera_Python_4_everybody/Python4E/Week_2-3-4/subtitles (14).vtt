2
00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:16.285
Our company's mission is to 
educate the world.

3
00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:18.589
We believe that education is the great

4
00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.541
equalizer and that many of 
the world's problems

5
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.509
could be made a lot better if more people
had access to education, and that

6
00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.253
includes problems like unemployment, 
like hunger, even

7
00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:34.917
extremism, and if you educate 
people you open doors for them,

8
00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.293
to make life better for

9
00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:39.160
themselves, for their families, 
and for the communities.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.820
For me this project started about four
years ago when a group of us

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.780
who had been award-winning faculty were
invited by John Bravman who was then the

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.470
Vice Provost for undergraduate 
education at Stanford

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.050
and he invited us to talk about how

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.700
to open up more room in the

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.800
curriculum for a meaningful engagement
between faculty and students.

16
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000
And there were a bunch of us in the room
and ideas were thrown around.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.870
Nothing particularly gelled.

18
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.010
And then two months later I 
happened to be at

19
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.590
a Google Faculty Summit, listening 
to a talk about YouTube.

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.230
And all of a sudden it came to me that
instead of lecturing in the classroom,

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.270
the same lecture that I'd been 
giving for fifteen years,

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.250
telling the same jokes 
at the same time,

23
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.090
maybe we could take that, and preserve it,
and in fact make it available to students

24
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.910
in a much more engaging format that has

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.240
more interaction than you get 
in a classroom.

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
So I went to, back to John Bravman and he
got very enthusiastic and

27
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.040
he took me to see President John Hennessey
of Stanford, who also was very excited

28
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.370
and in fact supported this project with a
generous seed grant in order to

29
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.580
try and build up the technology as well as
the pedagogy for making this happen.

30
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.940
And so we piloted this in my class 
and developed some of the

31
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.010
ideas that ended up making their way into
Coursera, including the short video

32
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.870
chunks, the integration of 
assessments into

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.320
the video stream, the significant 
number of

34
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.200
autograded assessments that 
allow the students

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.680
to test their knowledge of the material.

36
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.880
And, and so that was part of the project.

37
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.260
And then in parallel to that, 
my colleague and co-founder

38
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.830
Andrew Ng was actually working on a
different trajectory, which is let's

39
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.720
teach the world, and ended up 
developing pieces of the design

40
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.380
and technology and pedagogy independently
in the context of this other project.

41
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.190
And at some point we realized that the
projects were remarkably well

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.020
aligned because the same ideas, the same
designs, the same contents could

43
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.990
be used for both improving the quality of
the instruction for our

44
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.910
on-campus students and for offering a

45
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.150
meaningful course experience 
for the world.

46
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
And so that realization culminated 
in the fall of 2011

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.720
with the three large Stanford classes

48
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.030
that Stanford opened to the world, 
the machine learning class,

49
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.240
the database class, and the AI class.

50
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.440
And each of those classes 
had an enrollment of

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.460
100,000 students or more, 
which was just

52
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.520
a completely mind-blowing 
experience because no one

53
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.730
expected that to have this 
level of uptake.

54
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.070
And so in the fall, after we 
saw that this was

55
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.470
happening, we realized that we 
needed to do something with this.

56
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.280
We needed to build up on this success

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.950
and do something even bigger 
and more impactful.

58
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.230
And it seemed clear that in 
order to let this have as,

59
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.150
the largest impact that 
it could possibly have in

60
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.910
terms of teaching all these people 
around the world who

61
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.550
would never have access to this 
kind of high-quality education,

62
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.590
we needed to make this available not just
to Stanford, but to a number

63
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.740
of top institutions who could offer their
great content to all of these people.

64
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.600
And so that's when we decided to 
spin this out of Stanford

65
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.570
and make this, build up this platform that
would provide this great

66
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.860
experience for students as well as a good
experience for faculty to

67
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.140
effectively offer these large online
classes that they could open to the world.

68
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.200
>> But were you preparing for the fall of

69
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.230
2011 for like  a year, or, 
or did you just?

70
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.080
>> No.

71
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.330
It was kind of of a bit of a 
last-minute decision

72
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.690
to try out these classes 
in this format.

73
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.570
And I don't think anyone anticipated the
extent to which this would take

74
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.940
off and have this huge impact, and
uptake in the world.

75
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.320
>> So, really you kind of were laying down
a lot of the early code in the fall.

76
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.745
>> Yeah.

77
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:23.310
>> [LAUGH]

78
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.060
>> So, what happened was in 
I think August is when

79
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.640
the decision was made, and we 
realized that the platforms that

80
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.540
we had been using inside Stanford 
were just not up to

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.210
the task of being available, robustly, to
hundreds of thousands of students.

82
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.240
Or even tens of thousands, which is what we
thought we would have at that point.

83
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.110
And so we started to build up 
a platform from scratch

84
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.690
using a group of graduate students and
three undergraduates, just unbelievably

85
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.450
talented individuals, who ended up also
being the core group that

86
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.820
would form the engineering team of
Coursera down the line.

87
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.100
One of the things that we tried to

88
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.730
build into this project from the
very beginning are opportunities

89
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.070
for interaction of the students 
with the material, as

90
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.400
well as interaction of the students 
with their peers.

91
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.880
And there's different ways 
in which that happens.

92
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.850
In terms of interaction with 
the material, we do

93
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.630
a lot of active exercises where 
the system basically checks

94
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.850
the student's work so that the 
student is told whether

95
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.570
he or she are actually getting the
material or not.

96
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.770
And it's important that those 
tests, those, those

97
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.310
assessments, if you will, 
are deep and meaningful.

98
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.630
And on the other hand, they also need to
be graded at scale, because when you have

99
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.960
a hundred thousand students 
you can't have a TA or

100
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.960
an instructor in the loop 
manually checking papers.

101
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.570
And so we have all sorts of different
things that we can check at scale.

102
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.140
You know, multiple choice is the obvious

103
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.930
one, but one can also check 
numerical answers.

104
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.990
One can check, check math.

105
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.080
One can autograde programming
assignments, and by programming

106
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.720
assignments that just don't mean 
just code for computer sciences.

107
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.920
An Excel spreadsheet is a programming
assignment in effect too, and you

108
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.779
can now grade a financial model or a
marketing model as well.

109
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.470
But none of those are the kinds of
solutions that would allow us to support

110
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.250
all of the classes that we would like,

111
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.070
specifically when you want
classes that require

112
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.080
something that's more critical 
thinking where a

113
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.120
student would need to write down 
some argument

114
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.390
for one thing versus another 
or discuss the

115
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.020
arguments or the causal chain 
behind some historical event,

116
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.240
or do a, a detailed analysis of a
legal case or something.

117
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.020
You cannot do that using 
autograding right now.

118
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.780
Maybe if, maybe down the line, artificial
intelligence will solve that problem

119
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.910
for us, but I'm not counting on it 
in the near future.

120
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.980
And so how do you do that?

121
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.650
And that's where, again, the social
component of the platform,

122
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.380
which is the other big piece of it, 
has come to our help

123
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.040
because we ended up putting 
in place a peer-grading

124
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.660
pipeline where students can robustly and
reproducibly grade each other's work.

125
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.340
And it turns out that not only that 
is an effective way of

126
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.000
grading at scale, it's also a valuable

127
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.220
learning experience for the students, 
and studies have

128
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.480
not, not by us, but by educational
researchers, have shown that peer

129
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.740
rating teaches the students 
something, as well

130
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.850
as provides a scalable solution 
to grading.

131
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.030
One of the things that we try 
to build in is

132
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.640
an opportunity for students to interact
with each other in meaningful ways.

133
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.370
And have one student help each other
through the hard bits and

134
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.380
have the students work together to achieve
a better outcome for everyone.

135
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.330
And so, for example, we had a question 
and answer forum where

136
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.390
students really were the primary ones

137
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.110
responsible for answering 
each other's questions.

138
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.400
And there was a real community built up

139
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.170
around that where students felt 
incredibly motivated to

140
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.660
help each other and answer 
each other's questions

141
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.720
to the point that in the fall quarter of

142
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.600
2011, the median response time 
for a question

143
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.430
posted on the forum was 22 minutes, which

144
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.240
is not a level of service that

145
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.260
I, as an instructor, have ever 
offered my students.

146
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.340
But because there was such a broad

147
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.590
worldwide community of students 
all working together,

148
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.330
there was, even if you were 
doing something

149
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.510
at 3 o'clock in the morning, 
chances are that

150
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.210
somewhere around the world, 
there would be somebody

151
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.650
who was awake and thinking about 
the same problem.

152
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.640
And so that social community was really an

153
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.180
essential part, I think, of 
the student's experience.

154
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.680
And critical to the engagement 
and retention

155
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.560
of students in the, in the course.

156
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.770
>> I just imagine these people 
living in Zurich

157
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.950
getting together in a coffee shop

158
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.620
and as a study group.

159
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.720
So what, what were some of your
experiences, 

160
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.320
or others' experiences 
on study groups?

161
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.680
>> So it turned out that study groups
were something that we hadn't

162
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.420
built into the platform originally,
it's something that we will do soon.

163
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.880
But it grew organically. So people
basically, without even being suggested

164
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.820
to do that, ended up constructing 
study groups on the Q&A forums.

165
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.110
So they said that, we have a study group
in London, who wants to join us?

166
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:03.120
We have an, a, a study group of, of Arab
speakers or Hispanics or different

167
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.160
types of groupings depending on, you know,

168
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.540
geography or language or, or 
sometimes other things.

169
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.280
We have, in one class, a global

170
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.042
study group, which is specifically 
people who are looking

171
00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:20.400
to connect to people who are not part
of their local culture and geography.

172
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.250
And so this was really a fun thing for the
students and some of them met physically,

173
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.460
those that had geographical proximity, and
others just communicated in the

174
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.510
virtual space, but this organic growth
was just such a powerful thing for

175
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.280
students that we really quickly 
realized that

176
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.180
we needed to build this into the platform.

177
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.250
>> You probably are so busy that 
you don't have any time to

178
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.000
think too far in the future, but 
I'm going to just sort of see.

179
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.120
Where, what's your dream?

180
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.350
>> Our dream is that anyone 
around the world will have

181
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.460
an Internet connection, maybe via 
mobile device, which seems to be

182
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.940
the way to go in most developing 
countries right now because

183
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.860
of the way the infrastructure is
developed, or not developed until now.

184
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.230
And that people will be able to 
learn the things

185
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.370
that they care about. And 
some of these will

186
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.720
be things that are pragmatic 
and will help them

187
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.050
get a better job and make 
more money so they

188
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.160
can support their families. 
And some of them will

189
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.520
be just ways to expand one's 
understanding and one's imagination

190
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.720
by learning amazing things that 
you didn't know about

191
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.960
because I think it's unfortunate 
that for most of us

192
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.430
learning ends when we finish high school
or when we finish college and that's

193
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.990
the last time we learn anything. And
wouldn't it be really cool if we had

194
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.260
access to a life-long learning experience
that, where you could come and say,

195
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.090
I think this is a really cool topic 
and I'd like to learn more about that.

196
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.910
And you would have access to a really
amazing course

197
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.765
taught by the top scholar in 
his or her field

198
00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:49.758
that could teach that.

199
00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:59.758
