00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:25.965
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:32.315
>> Just look, looking around in 
2005, 2006,

4
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:35.335
at the number of people applying to

5
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.745
study computer science, and just this
sudden horrible realization 

6
00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:40.936
that we had driven off a cliff.

7
00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:43.330
And, you know, kind of like Wile E Coyote, 
you know, we'd driven, we'd gone off

8
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.881
a cliff, and now we look down, 
and, yeah, we're in real trouble.

9
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.363
So, so, yeah, it was just trying to

10
00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:54.940
eke our way back towards that 
1980s world, in which every

11
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.860
child who had wanted to be a 
computer programmer

12
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.080
had a machine that they could 
use to learn on.

13
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.684
Then there was this period of three or
four years, five years, where we were just

14
00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:05.440
kind of grinding through iterating
different, first of

15
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.681
all iterating different processor
architecture choices, different vendors.

16
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:13.210
So we started off with something that
actually looked a lot like an Arduino.

17
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.492
Turns out you can take one of those. 
We wanted it to be

18
00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:19.579
a real computer, we wanted it to be a
computer with a user interface.

19
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.023
And it turns out you can take those 
microcontrollers that are in,

20
00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:22.999
in the Arduino, and you 
can make them

21
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.131
generate a video signal if you, 
if you clock them hard enough 

22
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:27.910
and you write the right
software for them.

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.950
You can make them generate a

24
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410
component video, a standard-definition
component video signal.

25
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.958
And so we started off.

26
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.230
I had a, I still have it, it's a piece of

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.500
aeroboard which is about that
sort of size, 

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.060
which has a, an Atmel chip
on it and a block of SRAM.

29
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.738
And it gives you actually a very kind of a
1980s computer experience.

30
00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.454
And the lovely thing about it is

31
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:49.030
because they're all 0.1-inch 
through hole components,

32
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.390
you can build it yourself, you can 
build it in

33
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.660
it takes about an afternoon, 
a rainy afternoon.

34
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.390
You can go in with a piece of  
aeroboard and

35
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.870
some chips come out with a, come out 
with a computer.

36
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.360
And that seemed like a really nice idea,
but when you take it and

37
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.960
you show it to children, what you'll find
is they're not really, it's not exciting.

38
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.180
You know, it's not contemporary.

39
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.460
It's not, it's not modern.

40
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.370
You know, people, those computers 
we got in 1980s,

41
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.610
we didn't necessarily get them 
to learn to program on.

42
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.240
We got them to play games on, to, 
got them to do other things with.

43
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.080
And they just, wheedled their way 
into our lives.

44
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.210
Right?

45
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.920
They, they, they snuck into our lives and

46
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.840
once they were in our lives, then we 
learned to program.

47
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.590
We didn't necessarily get them.

48
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.760
Yeah, and so, so really I think 
probably most of that

49
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.830
five-year journey was about seeing if
we could reconcile

50
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.480
the idea of a $25 computer with a, with a

51
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.070
feature set that would make it 
attractive to a modern child.

52
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.490
And another thing we found with all of these,

53
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.010
with that and with some subsequent
architectures we tried,

54
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.960
what we found, all of which were based on

55
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.538
kind of very special-purpose pieces of
hardware, you know.

56
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.132
What we found was we were having to
everything ourselves.

57
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:48.537
So we were, we were writing our 
own SD card drivers,

58
00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.450
and our own terminal software, and
our own keyboard drivers.

59
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180
And, you know, you end up doing an enormous

60
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.190
amount of work because you've chosen to,
you have cheaped

61
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.530
out on some aspect of the hobby.

62
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.640
You're using some, some wacky DSP as your,
your processor.

63
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.110
You're writing this giant
software stack yourself.

64
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.110
And it was only really at the point 
where we, getting, from

65
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.470
a point where we put an arm,
we were lucky enough.

66
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.138
So I, my day job for most of that period
has been working for,

67
00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:14.820
working for a company called

68
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.065
Broadcom, they're a big famous
semiconductor company.

69
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:23.213
We make chips for communications. 
Pretty much every communications

70
00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:25.343
application has a, has a, 
has a Broadcom chip.

71
00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:30.511
And you know, we were, we're looking,
we were looking at a range,

72
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:34.586
we took the Raspberry Pi concept 
through a series of

73
00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:38.460
Broadcom chips, seeing whether we could
get something compelling.

74
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.190
And we were very lucky that towards the
end of that period,

75
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.110
one of these chips ended up with
an arm in it.

76
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.450
So we made that leap from a, from the
special-purpose world with us doing all

77
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.430
the work into a very general-purpose world

78
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.830
where really what we're making 
is an arm-like Xbox.

79
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.490
And so we, we're a not-for-profit.

80
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.510
You know, our funding came from 
a couple of us

81
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.890
throwing money in a hat, 
you know, quite a lot of

82
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.230
money in a hat, but you know, 
it was quite a big hat.

83
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.470
But you know, it was, that
seemed seemed appropriate.

84
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.740
But the thing that was really surprising
to us after we announced in 2011 after it

85
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.800
kind of almost leaked out, it was just kind
of a slip of the tongue, you know.

86
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.889
[LAUGH] We didn't, so we were
surprised by the level of interest.

87
00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:18.900
And it became apparent to us that we

88
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.350
really weren't going to be able to
manufacture these.

89
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.390
We weren't going to be able to 
manufacture them in anything like

90
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.210
the numbers that were going to be 
required to suit the demand.

91
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.860
And that's why, you come see us, 
if you go look back

92
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.509
at our web site, you see us in 2011
talking all about manufacturing.

93
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.430
And then towards the end of 2011, 
start of 2012,

94
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.910
our entire business changes, so we become
a, a licensing company.

95
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.830
So what we are now is this very 
capital-light licensing company.

96
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.990
We design this.

97
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.210
We, we work on the brand.

98
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.420
We work on the software.

99
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.560
We work on the hardware.

100
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.090
But all of the manufacturing, or the
capital provision, or

101
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.050
the logistics, they're all 
provided for us by our partners.

102
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.435
We have a couple of partners,

103
00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:58.830
RS components and Premier Farnell, 
who are kind of multi-billion-dollar

104
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.830
electronic component distributors,
and that's really

105
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.370
the thing that's let us go to scale.

106
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.850
The really wonderful thing is 
that we were able,

107
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.530
in terms of who does the
manufacturing, you

108
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.390
know, like everyone else, they don't
manufacture, they

109
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.320
commission manufacturing from a 
third party, from a CEM.

110
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.614
The wonderful thing for us was that 
last year

111
00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:17.650
we were able to move back, 
move our manufacturing back.

112
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.233
So we started building, like everyone else,
when you say I'm going to build

113
00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.822
something cheap, where am I going to build
it? I'm going to build it in China.

114
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.442
And, over the course of the last year,

115
00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:27.322
we've steadily reshored
manufacturing of these things

116
00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:30.409
to a point where now 100% of these
are being built in South Wales.

117
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.966
So they're being built in the UK.

118
00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:34.542
So that level of support, having these,
these kind of

119
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.502
big UK PLCs on our side has given us the

120
00:05:37.502 --> 00:05:39.686
kind of level of volume and the 
level of support

121
00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:41.610
that we needed in order to really 
make that happen.

122
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.010
>> What is really on this little
little chip?

123
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.210
That's like a whole, that's pretty much
it, right?

124
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.990
>> That's pretty much it and 
really you can see the Raspberry Pi  

125
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.740
almost as being a breakout
board for that chip.

126
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.530
So this chip's called BCM 2835,

127
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.820
it was designed here in Cambridge, 
it was designed by the

128
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.860
by the team that I'm, I'm a member of
just about two miles away from here.

129
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.330
It's a, it was originally intended 
as a coprocessor,

130
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.590
it was intended as a multimedia 
coprocessor for a mobile phone.

131
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.980
So if you've got a mobile phone platform
that's performing well,

132
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.160
because maybe it's half way through
its life, and you want to 

133
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.320
give it a little bit of a shot
in the arm and bring it up to, to

134
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.000
particularly maybe five years ago 
when we were moving from

135
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.630
a world of really fairly simple 
mobile phones to a

136
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.700
world in which every mobile phone is
expected to have

137
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.402
video playback and good camera processing
and 3D, 3D graphics,

138
00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:30.552
this could be used as a shot in the
arm processor to allow you to

139
00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:34.161
to bring an old platform up into,
up into the modern era.

140
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.680
And then the last one of them grew an arm.

141
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.340
So this thing already had a, already had
most of the other stuff you needed.

142
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.060
It could drive an HDMI display.

143
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.090
It could drive a standard-definition
display.

144
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.926
It could have a 3D accelerator 

145
00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:48.170
and a video accelerator and a 
camera processor and some DSP

146
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.713
and a USB controller, which was kind
of a unusual feature to have in there.

147
00:06:51.713 --> 00:06:53.220
And really, what we found was that we,

148
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.220
we were looking at this chip.

149
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.640
Man.

150
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.985
We are only an arm away.

151
00:06:56.985 --> 00:06:57.630
You know?

152
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.630
We're only an arm core away

153
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.800
from this being a 

154
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.490
a pro, a computer.

155
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.340
A single chip.

156
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.080
A single-chip computer.

157
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.800
So we were lucky enough to be able to get
an arm core into the,

158
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.632
the, the last step in the 2835, the final
productional step grew an arm 11.

159
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.050
And that's what allows us to relax.

160
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.320
The really interesting thing is being that
most of what, a lot

161
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.900
of what people have done with this, has
been hardware hacking, you know.

162
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.820
We have this, these GPIs here, 
which for me were

163
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.790
kind of a little of an afterthought 
in the design, but in practice a

164
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.620
lot of the cool stuff people have been
doing, adults and children, 

165
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.260
have been about using this
as a machine.

166
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.220
Because you, you ask what can this, is
this just a cheap PC?

167
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.990
What can this do that a PC can't do?

168
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.320
And in a lot of ways it is just a 
cheap PC.

169
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080
But this stuff is something that, 
you know, your most

170
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.830
expensive PC can't do without an 
add-on, an add-on card.

171
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.650
And so people have been, you know, 
taking these. They've been

172
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.580
putting them in boats, and they've been
putting them in planes, 

173
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.920
and they've been putting them
under balloons

174
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.410
and sending them up to the edge of space.

175
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.695
And they've been using them to 
automate their homes.

176
00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:59.230
There's a wonderful example someone had
the other day of an augmented microwave.

177
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.755
He'd taken an old microwave and 
completely overhauled the, the, the

178
00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.430
user experience of using this microwave 
so it had, like a new,

179
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.600
a new touch panel on, it had 
voice commands, it had a 

180
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.270
web interface so you could control it
from your IPad.

181
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.470
It had a bar code scanner, so you could
scan your, the product.

182
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.650
And he'd built a database of mapped bar
codes to cooking instructions,

183
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.540
so you could just scan it, put it in, 
and it would cook it for you.

184
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.660
And he built this thing with a 
Raspberry Pi, you know?

185
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.890
These, it's given people access to a kind
of a level of technology.

186
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.020
It's given people access to a 
platform that they

187
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.178
can use to do all this really 
amazing stuff.

188
00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:35.030
And so it's wonderful because, 
you know,

189
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.890
a lot of people doing this are 
adults, right?

190
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.010
But the lovely thing is, a lot of these
things adults are doing with it

191
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.320
feed immediately into the range of
projects that are available for teachers.

192
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.180
We take this and we take it into schools,
and at the end of the lessons,

193
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.920
mixed-ability classes, you know, 
at the end of the lessons

194
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.050
there's always a hard core of
kids, boys and girls,

195
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.400
who you have to basically pry this little
thing out of their hands.

196
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.870
Because, you know particularly if it's
their first experience at programming.

197
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.790
And even if they've done 
something very simple, like

198
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.560
taken a, we, we often use like a

199
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560
snake game, and even if they've done 
very simple stuff

200
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.010
like change the color of the snake or make

201
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.990
the snake go a little bit faster, 
that kind of power,

202
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.180
you can see it in their eyes.

203
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.890
You know, they are like, hang on a second,
I can make this machine do what I want.

204
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.465
And, and for some, for, for, for a sizable
minority of children, that's

205
00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:26.901
a really, as it was for me, I think
a transformative experience.
