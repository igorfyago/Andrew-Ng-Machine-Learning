00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello and I'd like to
talk to you about how

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.520
to use the snipping tool
to do a screen capture.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.928
There are other ways to do this,
but the easiest way is

4
00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:11.105
the built-in screen tool, and I'm doing
this on Windows 8.

5
00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:14.948
The snipping tool exists on earlier
versions of Windows as well, and so the

6
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.974
gestures and the UI might look a little
different, but it's about the same.

7
00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:20.020
You'll find the snipping tool.

8
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.070
So I'm going to hit the Windows icon

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.900
and I'm going to type the s-n, and it
brings up the snipping tool.

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.430
And so here I go, and it's giving me this
option to say snipping tool.

11
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.180
And I'd like to say, I'm going to
do a new Windows snip.

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.200
And now it's kind of graying out the

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.950
screen and following me around
with this red line.

14
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.960
And I click on this and it has made a copy
of that, of that window.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.780
Now I'm, this is, snipping tool
is just a snipping tool.

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.750
That window still exists but this is now,
well I didn't want to do that.

17
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.920
This is now just a, a drawing tool that's

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180
So, and so here you are.

19
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.240
We could save this.

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.880
But the other thing you can do,
and this is

21
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.980
in the more recent snipping tools,
is you can make changes.

22
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.650
So let's say for example that
you didn't want to

23
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.420
show your name, and your name
was in this path.

24
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.770
And so I will just go and scribble my name
out, like with this little scribbling tool.

25
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.940
Pretty sweet, huh?

26
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.430
So I scribbled my name out, and I just
happened to have

27
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.310
my name in it and so I didn't
want to put it in.

28
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.180
So now I'm going to do File > Save As.

29
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.460
And of course find somewhere, I'm going to
put this

30
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.690
on my desktop and I'm going to call it
notepad.png.

31
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.320
Now you don't have to put the suffix of
.png or JPEG but

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.210
it's good if you're moving files between
systems to put these suffixes on.

33
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.840
You know, Windows would know that this is a
.png file,

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.910
but .png is a way to nicely tell other

35
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.480
systems when you're moving it around
that it's a .png file,

36
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.440
or if you send it as an email or
whatever.

37
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.029
So I save it, I'm saving it on my desktop.

38
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.270
And there we go.

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.520
So it's, it's hiding the .png, but I can
look to make sure

40
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.060
the png is really there, and so there it
is, it's a .png.

41
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.010
So there's a file, and away we go.

42
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.900
Okay?

43
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.315
So there's the snipping tool. If I close
this window, and I click on Notepad,

44
00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:22.530
[SOUND] you will see that it's got the
little scribbling thing.

45
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.680
Thank you for that.

46
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.350
Okay?

47
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.020
So there you go.

48
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.550
That's how to do a real simple
snipping tool.
