2
00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:26.947
When I'm writing an operating system,
I'm saying, oh here's this problem

3
00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:30.660
I've gotta solve, and here's these
specifications in performance.

4
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030
I'm thinking like a computer scientist.

5
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.230
But when I'm writing a Python program,

6
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.970
it's like looking through a mailing list
for certain kind of mail messages, and

7
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.760
then matching those mailing
message up with something else.

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.980
Or it's seeing who the most
prolific poster in your forum is.

9
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180
What you are really doing is,
you are slowly but

10
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.300
surely putting yourself into that program.

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
We're in Milan, Italy with one of
the largest office hours ever.

12
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.310
And I'd like to do our
standard introduction so

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.300
that you can see everybody.

14
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.710
So give us your name and say hi,
or say something about the course.

15
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.814
>> [CROSSTALK] Hi, Malcolm,
I just really like the course.

16
00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:09.182
I don't have anything to say.

17
00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:09.897
>> Okay.

18
00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:14.156
>> I am Luca, and I am here for

19
00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:18.045
[INAUDIBLE] sometimes.

20
00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:18.972
>> Okay.

21
00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:19.995
>> Hi, I'm Evar.

22
00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:25.730
I like the teacher and
I really love the course.

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.630
>> Great, thank you.

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.690
>> Hi, I'm Sebastian, and
I attended the Internet History course.

25
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.830
>> Great.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.875
>> Hi, this is Anarita, learning Python
and getting excited about the course.

27
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:36.825
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.684
>> Ciao, I'm Barbara,
and I like your course.

29
00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:40.907
Thank you, Dr. Chuck.

30
00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:41.833
>> Thank you, Barbara.

31
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.603
>> [LAUGH]
>> Hi, I'm Alberto.

32
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.275
I just want to learn programming.

33
00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:45.948
>> Okay.

34
00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:48.246
>> Hi, I'm Andrea,
I took Internet History.

35
00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:51.361
And when I read that Dr. Chuck was coming,
I started screaming, oh, Dr.

36
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.751
Chuck is coming, in the office.

37
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:56.652
>> [LAUGH]
>> No one understood, but anyway.

38
00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:57.306
>> Okay.
>> Hi,

39
00:01:57.306 --> 00:02:00.075
I'm David,
it's my first course on Coursera.

40
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.788
And I wish everybody good luck,
and stay focused on your goals.

41
00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:08.445
>> And now we meet the famous
community teaching assistant Mauro.

42
00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:10.261
Yay!
>> [APPLAUSE]

43
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.567
>> Yeah!

44
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.210
So Mauro, say hi,
whatever you want to say.

45
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.476
>> Oh, and yes,
we finally succeed in bringing Dr.

46
00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:24.450
Chuck here in Italy and
we have a very big, oh!

47
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.761
>> [LAUGH]
>> [CROSSTALK] We have a very big group

48
00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:28.860
[INAUDIBLE].

49
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.995
>> So after that brief interruption
by the construction crew,

50
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:39.590
we'll go back to talking to Mauro,
our intrepid community teaching assistant.

51
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.710
>> I am out here.

52
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.712
Finally, we succeed in bringing Dr.
Chuck in Italy.

53
00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:47.900
Very successful Office Hour here.

54
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.893
A lot of people are both from Programming
for Everybody and Internet History.

55
00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:57.620
I am very happy,
very happy about our people.

56
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.210
Thank you.

57
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.190
>> Okay, so we missed one person.

58
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.950
Do you want to say hi?

59
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.219
>> [INAUDIBLE] Hi, my name is Zura and

60
00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.630
I am-
>> She is my wife.

61
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.084
[CROSSTALK] She didn't take any courses.

62
00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:07.910
>> You didn't take any courses, okay.

63
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.380
But you will.
>> I will, yes.

64
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.914
>> Of course you will.

65
00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:11.724
>> [LAUGH]
>> You have to.

66
00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.560
Okay so, let's see.

67
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.990
Now, let me get a nice group picture.

68
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.670
And let's give Mauro a nice round
of applause, thanking him for

69
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.315
how awesome he is for doing what he does.

70
00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:24.857
>> Thank you, Mauro!

71
00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:30.244
>> [APPLAUSE]

72
00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:40.244
