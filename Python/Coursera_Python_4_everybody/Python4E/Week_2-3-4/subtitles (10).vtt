00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.470
Hello and welcome to the podcast on
taking screenshots on the Macintosh.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.820
Nicely, Macintosh has a very simple tool
built in.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.800
We go into Macintosh hard drives, we go to

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.910
Applications, and then we search down for
Preview.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.210
P, p, p Preview, Preview right here.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.590
So, Preview, and I'll close this now.

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.410
So, we've got Preview.

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.690
Preview's the application that that was
originally built to view PDFs on

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.780
the Macintosh, but it also has a whole
series of screen capture capabilities.

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.790
And I like to keep Preview in my dock all
the time, so I

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.050
come down here on the Preview icon And,
oh, it's already in my dock.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.880
If I said remove from dock.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.440
And then I would say keep in dock.

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.470
It was already there.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.930
As soon as I start Preview, I always keep
it in the dock.

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.810
I put all the things I need to use all the
time in the dock.

17
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.640
And so let's take a screenshot.

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.110
I'll just sort of start a jEdit program.

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.570
And I'll say, Take me as a screenshot,
whatever.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.390
Doesn't matter.

21
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.780
Just this is the window that I want to
take a picture of, this window right here.

22
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.200
So I go to Preview and I say File, this
is in the most logical place.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.420
You can either grab a rectangular
selection, which you'll be allowed to

24
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.581
draw with your cursor, or a window, or the
whole screen when timed.

25
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:33.780
90% of the time what you really want to
do is take a window.

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.330
You can say, grab window, it, it tells,
you,

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.470
oh, you know you can grab, go over
different windows.

28
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.780
I can click here, I can click there.

29
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.310
And click there.

30
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.460
And I just want to capture this window.

31
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.930
So, click.

32
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.220
I go like that.

33
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.460
Now here's a little weird.

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.580
This is now an image, okay?

35
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.550
And so you can't click on this
stuff.

36
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.310
Okay?

37
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.910
That's that.

38
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.920
So what you need to do, I'm going to close

39
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.370
the original real window now, this is my
jEdit.

40
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.740
I'm going to Cmd+Q to get rid of the
jEdit.

41
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.030
And I do not want to save that file.

42
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.120
So now I'm in Preview.

43
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.100
See, I'm in Preview here.

44
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.940
And so, I've got this as, as an image.

45
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.260
Now the one thing it does, is it always
saves it to your desktop.

46
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.840
So which gets to be sort of painful as a,
after a while.

47
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.740
And gives them them long names called
snapshot that has

48
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.380
the date and stores it in this format
called .tiff.

49
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.410
So I prefer to switch it to a, you know,
non-Apple format.

50
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.791
So I want to do a Save As, and I'm
going to save this, save this as a .jpeg.

51
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.150
And I'd give it a, a better name, called
First Image.

52
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.170
And it'll be a .jpeg.

53
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.690
And I'm going to store it right on my
desktop.

54
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.040
So now here we have First Image, okay.

55
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.240
And I can click on that and take a look at
it.

56
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.960
I'll close this.

57
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.120
Click on it.

58
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.600
Interestingly, it just comes back up in
Preview.

59
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320
So, that's pretty much it.

60
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.820
This would be the file that you would
upload, if your job was to do this.

61
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.790
I'll show you a couple other tricks that I

62
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.700
like to make my images a little bit
better.

63
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.450
Now, Preview has a simple tool for
cropping.

64
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.280
And the way you crop something is you say,
you draw a rectangle here

65
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.230
on the image, and then you say Tools, Crop.

66
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.070
And I've gotten rid of all the rest of
that image except that which I want.

67
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.600
And I'll say save this as It's a .jpeg,
and I wan't to save it as .jepg.

68
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.100
Tiny.

69
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.980
I'll save it as tiny.

70
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.390
And so I now have two images.

71
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.370
I got that first image.

72
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.490
And I got this tiny image.

73
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.061
And there it is.

74
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:48.190
I'll use Cmd+W to quickly close it.

75
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.760
I really like, I mean Apple+W to quickly
close it.

76
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.250
And so the one thing is, you just, after a
while, your

77
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.380
snapshots fill up on your desk, and so
just keep cleaning them off.

78
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.140
And if you were uploading to hand in a
screenshot

79
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.310
or whatever, this would be the file that
you upload.

80
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.040
So that's pretty much all there is.

81
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.000
Use the preview command.

82
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.390
To take screenshots with the grab and
typically it's grab window.

83
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.510
Okay? Thanks.
