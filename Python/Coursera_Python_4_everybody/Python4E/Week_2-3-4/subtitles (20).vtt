2
00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:16.867
>> Piazza's an online question-and-answer
platform that I built

3
00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.924
out of my own inspiration, based on my
experiences from my undergrad.

4
00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:24.630
So, I did my undergrad when a very few
women in computer science in India.

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900
Top engineering school, IIT.

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.340
And I had actually studied in an all-girls
high school till college, did not

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.470
know how to speak to boys, was told,
never allowed to speak to boys.

8
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.650
So when I went to college, 
I didn't know how

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.150
to speak to boys, and all my 
classmates were boys.

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.630
Studied by myself, felt very isolated.

11
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.560
And really felt a frustration 
at doing assignments by myself 

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.460
and trying to study for exams
by myself.

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.970
And I came to America to do my

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.528
masters in computer science at 
Maryland College Park.

15
00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:57.677
Came out to Bay Area, California, 
worked as a software

16
00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:00.759
engineer at Oracle, at Facebook, 
at Cosmix. And when I

17
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.908
went to Stanford Business School 
for my MBA, I realized today

18
00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:09.220
with technology, actually laptops
and high-speed Internet, everywhere,

19
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.230
many students end up sitting by 
themselves in their dorm rooms.

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.240
And that feeling of isolation is actually

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740
pretty common among many
young students today.

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.860
So really, Piazza's meant to simulate the
sort of real face-to-face discussion that

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.650
I witnessed in my undergrad, but could not
partake in, because too shy.

24
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.950
>> Did you start working on it when you
were working on your master's degree?

25
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.140
>> My MBA, yes.

26
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.110
I you know, it, midway through my first

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010
year, I took an entrepreneurship 
class at Stanford.

28
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.540
And the one thing that entrepreneurs here
in Silicon Valley that who came to speak

29
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.410
in our class, the one thing they said

30
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.190
is think about an idea you're 
passionate about.

31
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.010
And for me that idea was how can 
I help students,

32
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.000
particularly women studying kind of
science and engineering subjects,

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.520
feel less isolated.

34
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700
So that summer between first and
second year of business school

35
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.970
I moved in with my brother 
and his family,

36
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.195
worked out of their garage, 
built the first prototype of Piazza.

37
00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:04.060
I had not done any web development
until then.

38
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.590
So I picked up a book on Ruby on Rails.

39
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.930
Had never written a line of HTML or CSS,
because all

40
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.060
I knew was kind of serve, server
technology, C, C++.

41
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.430
I knew how to use GDB, and so I picked up

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.860
a book on Rails, and learnt it all 
and built a site

43
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.890
in ten days, and launched it to one class
that fall of 2009.

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.660
That grew to three classes in
January of 2010, and about

45
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.020
ten classes at Stanford in 2010 Fall.

46
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.730
That suddenly grew to 65 classes 
in Spring of 2011,

47
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.990
and many of the professors, 
I did not even know.

48
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.140
So that was indicating to me that, you
know, something was working.

49
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.860
And students were liking it, and
professors were liking it.

50
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.100
So suddenly I contacted professors at
Berkeley, and MIT,

51
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.620
and Princeton, and Harvard,

52
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.630
and within a month, we had over

53
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.170
20,000 students at these 
five schools using Piazza.

54
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.840
>> And were you still sort of 
doing this with you as the

55
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.572
main developer, with 20,000 accounts

56
00:03:03.572 --> 00:03:04.835
[LAUGH] and you as the main developer?

57
00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:07.960
And like were you using a credit card to
paying for a server or two?

58
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.830
>> It's just, it's barely maybe $50 to
$100 a month to host or not even

59
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.950
so I did find one developer who 
had a daytime job.

60
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.610
to pay his bills and, you know, his 
family's bills, and he had

61
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.260
some server space, so we just hosted on
whatever server space he had.

62
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.690
And it was at this point that we went
ahead and raised a

63
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.848
seed round of, you know, a little over a
million dollars with Sequoia Capitol.

64
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.690
>> Do you kind of have any philosophy of
the right way to

65
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.450
approach being an entrepreneur, and what
sort of what, what's your sort of

66
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.510
>> Yeah, I definitely lean towards 
the slow.

67
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.720
I truly believe in creating value first,
not getting caught up in numbers,

68
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.780
In fact, February of 2010 it turned out
that the founder

69
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.790
of TechCrunch was seated next to me
on a plane, and when he

70
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.740
did ask me, you know, I'd love to 
write an article about you,

71
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.610
my first kind of knee-jerk 
reaction was no, because I

72
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.990
knew that would bring lots of 
people to want to use Piazza.

73
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.820
Piazza was very, very 

74
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
in its nascent stages of product
development, you know.

75
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.040
And it was a good call, I think,
because that whole year of 2010

76
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.460
I didn't care about numbers, I didn't care

77
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.110
about how many students or how 
many professors.

78
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.010
All I cared about was I had a 
hand full of professors

79
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.300
and students that I could sit with and
learn and watch and observe.

80
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.750
Today I believe that I have 
very deep empathy.

81
00:04:29.904 --> 00:04:32.190
And, you know I think it's really 
important to build a product

82
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.630
that adds value, that comes from 
often just staying very small,

83
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.560
because you can isolate the 
types of users you want

84
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.120
whose use cases matches the sort of 
use cases you built a product for.

85
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.410
>> You became a mom in the middle 
of that whole story.

86
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.570
>> Mmm hmm

87
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.460
>> Talk a little bit about 

88
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.400
about how that all works 
>>Sure

89
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.320
>> And came together.

90
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.820
>> Yeah, so about five months ago
I had a baby son, Arjun, and

91
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.830
I'm very fortunate that I live with my

92
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.780
husband's parents, we all 
live together and they,

93
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.760
you know his parents understand 
that they really,

94
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.190
I need their support to be able to run

95
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.130
a company while being a mother. And both
are very important, I want to be a mother,

96
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.250
I want to raise children and bring them,

97
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.460
you know, just want to raise them. 
At the same time.

98
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.720
I really believe in the company 
that I've built and

99
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.760
the impact it's making on students 
and teachers and continue to,

100
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.170
continue to do what I have been doing.

101
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.160
So with their support, I would say 
it's been actually pretty easy.

102
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.740
One thing I really like to do is actually
be in another place, by myself,

103
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.820
so whether that's working out, or
whether that's going on a long walk,

104
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.340
that allows me to pull myself away from
the weeds either for Piazza or for my son.

105
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.890
There's a dish that's the Stanford dish,
right behind Stanford.

106
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.280
I hear, I hear Steve Jobs used to go there
and a couple other great

107
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.490
people who I derive a lot of inspiration
from, that they go there a lot.

108
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.750
So I like to walk there 
a few times a week.

109
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.664
I found that that very first 
summer in 2009 when I had

110
00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.356
to build a prototype and find the first
few professors to use Piazza.

111
00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:10.396
I remember I used to walk the dish

112
00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:13.736
five times a week, and I would 
only work four to six hours,

113
00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:15.556
or maybe eight hours, but it
was never, and

114
00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:18.270
I had a successful product by 
the end of the summer.

115
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.386
And I had a class using Piazza and 
I know the dish, walking the dish,

116
00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:27.458
brought me focus and that allowed to
be very productive with my time

117
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:37.458
