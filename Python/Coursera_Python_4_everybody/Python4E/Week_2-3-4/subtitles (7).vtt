00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.344
Hello and welcome to my video that shows how to get started

2
00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:09.855
and install Python on Microsoft Windows.

3
00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.410
Okay? So, it's not too hard.

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.480
We're going to both install Python 3 and we're going to install Text Editor.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.660
And so, I'm just going to go into Google and then I install Python 3.

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.129
And my top link is downloading Python,

7
00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.399
and there is my link for downloading Python 3.5.2.

8
00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.024
This version of my class uses Python 3.

9
00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.030
I have an earlier class that you may have seen

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.145
that uses Python 2 but in this class we're going to do this.

11
00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.890
Now, it might take you a while to download this.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.825
I've actually already downloaded it.

13
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.744
Now, the other thing we need is a program or

14
00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:52.413
text editor and you can really use any program or text editor.

15
00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:54.950
We know – we've used Notepad Plus in the past.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.075
We've use, jEdit in the past.

17
00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.187
I like atom, atom.io,

18
00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:06.650
T-O-M.io, mostly because it works the same on Windows and Mac and Linux.

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.150
But you can really use any text editor that you like,

20
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.590
just don't use Word or,

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.339
Text Edit that comes with the operating system.

22
00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.489
You need a programming editor that doesn't mess with

23
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.834
weird characters or weird lines or strange formats.

24
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:28.010
You must have a real programmer editor and some have down –,

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.780
I've already downloaded this as well.

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.739
And so, I won't waste the time

27
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.920
waiting to download it but let's go ahead and do the installation.

28
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.334
So, these things – these things ended up in my,

29
00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:53.924
my downloads file, so I'll go to downloads and I'll start installing Python 3.5.2.

30
00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:57.090
Now, it's going to ask me some things,

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.090
add Python 3.5 to the path and that's a good idea.

32
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.829
Install the launcher for all users.

33
00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.750
I'm going to add that.

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.700
Maybe you will, maybe you won't do that.

35
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.848
It's going to tell me where it's going to install it.

36
00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:14.379
Install now.

37
00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.701
Of course, it's going to ask me for permission to do these things.

38
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:28.069
And now it's running through the installation.

39
00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.814
Okay. So there we go.

40
00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:34.252
You could maybe click on this online tutorial on documentation.

41
00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:35.650
But we're just going to close

42
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.960
this and I'm going to start and run the Windows command line.

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.879
Now, you may have all kinds of fancy ways to run Python

44
00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.669
but I like running the command line, C-O-M-M-A-N-D.

45
00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.474
I like writing the command line because you,

46
00:02:57.474 --> 00:03:02.905
it's, after awhile it's important to know what folder things are being run in.

47
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:07.865
And so here's this command line and I should be able to type Python here.

48
00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:13.859
And so now, I'm in Python 3.2 and this is the Chevron prompt.

49
00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.927
Here is the python interpreter where it's asking for Python commands.

50
00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:24.770
And I can say print 'hello, world'.

51
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.819
Of course, this is what we tend to print all the time.

52
00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.914
I can make a mistake.

53
00:03:29.914 --> 00:03:36.689
I can say blu-blu-blu.

54
00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.094
Right?

55
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.719
And it will complain to me.

56
00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.522
Now, to get out of this I can either type control Z or quit.

57
00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:47.520
In this case, I'm gonna type control Z and I'm back to the prompt.

58
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.919
Couple of things – I can do a 'dir" to see

59
00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.305
what folders and files I have and that is like my desktop.

60
00:03:55.305 --> 00:04:00.189
And then the cd command tells me where I'm at in the folder.

61
00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.574
That means, I'm in the user's directory, drchu.

62
00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:07.405
Okay? So, I have now installed Python.

63
00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:10.094
I ran the Python interpreter to verify it.

64
00:04:10.094 --> 00:04:12.050
I said print 'hello world'.

65
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.775
Okay. And so, now what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually install atom.

66
00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:20.379
I already had this downloaded so let's go ahead and install atom on my computer.

67
00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:37.939
Okay.

68
00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.589
So atom is now installed and is,

69
00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:41.930
kind of, telling us what to do.

70
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.870
I'm going to actually just close all these windows,

71
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.389
close this window, close everything,

72
00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.625
and I'm going to create a file.

73
00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.026
I'm going to say print–.

74
00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:58.494
In this case, let's see if I can make this bigger.

75
00:04:58.494 --> 00:05:00.379
I can make it bigger.

76
00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.774
So, I'm going to type print 'hello from a file'.

77
00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:09.134
Okay. And I'm gonna save this.

78
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:15.274
I'm gonna save 'file'. Save As.

79
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:19.110
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my desktop

80
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.980
and I'm going to make

81
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.975
a folder on the desktop and I'm gonna call this folder, PY4E.

82
00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:33.839
So, I now have a folder on the desktop.

83
00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.893
Move this here, I'll move this here.

84
00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:42.370
And, I'm going to go into PY4E and then I'm going to

85
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.180
name this file first.py.

86
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.685
And you'll notice that when I save this,

87
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.620
when I save this,

88
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.800
it, it syntax highlighted it.

89
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.410
That's one of the nice things about a programmer editor.

90
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.699
Okay. And so it says, "oh,

91
00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.779
it's got a suffix of.py".

92
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.819
So therefore it knows that it's supposed to look pretty with Python and,

93
00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.214
make this one color, make this another color.

94
00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:13.723
The other thing that you'll notice is I now have a folder called PY4E

95
00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:19.170
and if I am in this command line– let me just start that up again.

96
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.879
I'll show you how to start the command line again.

97
00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.454
Command.

98
00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:30.069
Now, if I do a dir I see the folders that I'm

99
00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.078
in and one of the folders that you can see here is the desktop folder.

100
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:37.402
So, I'm gonna say CD desktop.

101
00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:41.810
And then I'm type the dir command to see what folders are in the desktop.

102
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.524
These folders are the same as these folders.

103
00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:48.449
These things are kind of virtual folders.

104
00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.529
PY4E is PY4E.

105
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.199
Now, I can type CD which stands for change directory.

106
00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.990
PY4E.

107
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.380
And I can do a dir and now you see first.PY.

108
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.879
And that's the same as if I'm diving into this folder.

109
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.785
Here's this file, first.PY.

110
00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:10.084
Windows hides the suffix which is somewhat

111
00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:14.660
annoying and frustrating but that suffix is there.

112
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.334
That file is there.

113
00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:17.779
And so for me,

114
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.360
one of the things you've got to figure out in Windows is how to make sure

115
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.120
that you are in the same folder,

116
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.385
users drchu.

117
00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:26.303
Desktop py4e.

118
00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:30.250
And that's this name of this file and here as well.

119
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.035
And now I'm going to run this program.

120
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:38.810
I'm going to type 'python first.py'.

121
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.220
And you see that it ran the Python code. Okay.

122
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.720
Another way you can do this is you can type

123
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.589
'first.py' and that's because this file association has happened in Windows.

124
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.100
This doesn't work in Macintosh.

125
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.514
This only works in Windows,

126
00:07:54.514 --> 00:07:57.709
that all files with.py are expected to be

127
00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.375
Python and it knows the Python interpreter where to run.

128
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.040
Okay. And so, I've got Python 3.0 installed.

129
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.367
And that gets me started.

130
00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:10.860
And so I– I hope that

131
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.709
this little introduction about getting things started and

132
00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:16.740
writing your first Python program has been helpful to you.
