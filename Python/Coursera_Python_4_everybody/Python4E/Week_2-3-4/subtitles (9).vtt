00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:11.544
In this video we're actually
going to download and

3
00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.990
install Python 3 from python
dot org on a Macintosh.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.180
If your Macintosh for
years has wonderfully come with Python 2.

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.631
So if I type python version,
then I type that.

6
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.716
I see that I only got Python 2.0.

7
00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.650
What we want to do is in
addition install Python 3.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.321
One of these days Macintosh might upgrade
their distributed version of Python 3,

9
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.707
but there's so many things inside
Mac that depend on Python 2.

10
00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:45.679
I'm going to expect that it
will always be named Python 3,

11
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.040
which is what we're going to
call it In a second.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.139
So here I am at the Python.org downloads,
and I'm going to download Python 3.

13
00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:59.525
You click here, and I've actually got
it sitting here in downloads already,

14
00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.350
because I always do that.

15
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.638
And so, I'm going to install this.

16
00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.682
There is the installer.

17
00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.052
I'll going to say continue,
continue, continue.

18
00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:12.708
Of course I agree,
I read all that really fast.

19
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.172
And now I'm going to install it.

20
00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:20.552
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay, so
now that means if I run a terminal,

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.018
so this of course is start run terminal.

23
00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:37.799
So Python 2 is still there, but
Python 3 is also now there.

24
00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.940
So we should have Python 3 installed.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.131
So we installed Python 3.6.

26
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:43.469
And so there we go, and

27
00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.810
that's all it takes to install
Python 3 on the Macintosh.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.767
So let's write our first
little Python program.

29
00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:57.143
I'm going to, I like Atom.

30
00:01:57.143 --> 00:02:01.446
And so I've got this Atom editor,
it's atom.io.

31
00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:05.013
Right here, atom.io, download and
install the Atom editor.

32
00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:11.650
I like it because Atom works the same
on both Windows, Mac and Linux.

33
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.865
And it has syntax highlighting, and
so I really like things like that.

34
00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:19.487
So I'm going to make myself
a simple Python program.

35
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.329
Hello world, like we always do.

36
00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.295
Now you'll notice that it's not
syntax highlighting yet, but

37
00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:30.021
I'm going to do a File,
Save, oopsie daisy.

38
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:35.726
File > Save As, and
I'm going to go into my Desktop,

39
00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:40.118
and I want to make a folder called py4e.

40
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:46.903
I'm just kind of call this hello.py.

41
00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:50.577
Crud, I'm gotta rename it.

42
00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:53.885
Rename it I ended up with two dots.

43
00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.340
Hello dot py, there we are.

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.102
And so now I'm here and
I'm in my home folder.

45
00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:03.074
I can go into my desktop and I can go
into that new folder I made, Python for

46
00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.230
everybody.

47
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.248
And I can see the files.

48
00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:11.073
Now, there are ways to run this and
I really want you to learn the terminal so

49
00:03:11.073 --> 00:03:13.767
that you really know what you're doing.

50
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:16.971
And so here we are,
we are in the folder that has the Python.

51
00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:22.010
And then all we do to run it is we
say Python3hello.py and there we go.

52
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.409
And of course this is Python 3 because
I'm using parentheses there, so

53
00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.330
instead of double quotes.

54
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.968
But Python 2 is still there.

55
00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:38.571
And of course if you just run Python
hello.py, it'll be a syntax error or not.

56
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:39.900
Must be they added something.

57
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.769
[LAUGH] Yeah.

58
00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.620
because Python is still version,
still version 2, but

59
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.560
apparently they allowed print in
the latest version of Python 2.

60
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.480
So away we go.

61
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.760
Okay, so again, thanks for watching.

62
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.029
I hope this was helpful to you to get

63
00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:08.220
Python 3 installed on your Macintosh.

64
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.799
