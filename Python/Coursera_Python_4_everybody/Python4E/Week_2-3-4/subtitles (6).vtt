00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:10.140
So welcome to this week.

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.690
Last week, we talked about like the theory
of programming and computer science,

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.780
and the macarena and
all that kind of stuff, and that's cool.

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.450
But now,

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.800
we're going to start writing programming,
writing programs using Python.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.870
And one of the things we're trying to
encourage you to do is install Python and

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.330
run it, because sooner or later,
you are going to have to do that, right?

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.270
You're going to have to install it and
run it, we got a bunch of videos.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.160
But in courses one and courses two,
you don't actually have do that.

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.784
Now, we know that some people are using
iPads, or Chromebooks, or something else,

11
00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:43.648
and you can't install Python, or

12
00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:47.490
maybe you're at a school
that can't install Python.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.230
So it's great that you
can write Python programs

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.360
using software we've
provided in the browser.

15
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.010
And we have this Python playground,
and so as you go through the course,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.120
you'll find assignments
that you have to do.

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.510
But what this is, is this is an ungraded
assignment, Python Code Playground.

18
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.250
And so it's launched externally using
a technology called learning tools

19
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.240
interoperability, so
it's going to pop this open in a new tab.

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.770
So you see that it's in a new tab, right?

21
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.543
And it's called a Python Code Playground.

22
00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:18.860
Now, this is kind of like the autograder
except it has no expectations, and

23
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.660
you can write any code that you want,
okay?

24
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.579
And so let me hit the reset code button.

25
00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.026
And you can always go back
to the default code, and

26
00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:29.470
this is the code that's there for you.

27
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.266
And if I want to run it, I can just
say go ahead and run this code, right?

28
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.360
And so the code runs, and
the output's over here.

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.658
So it actually ran the Python,
and the code came out over here.

30
00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:44.240
Now this is a file, this is chapter seven,
it's even from course two.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.540
So the default code here is probably
not what you want to play with.

32
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.724
You can play with something like print,
play, exclamation

33
00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:59.030
point, and run that, and so runs the code
and then your output comes here.

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.833
Now, there are three files which is later
chapter seven and later that you can use.

35
00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:06.431
These are the sample files that we used
throughout a lot of these assignments in

36
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:08.340
the book, and where you go.

37
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.043
And so you can do whatever you want,
here, it's not being graded.

38
00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:16.001
There's no grade being sent back
to Coursera, and so, away you go.

39
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.509
And if you're writing Python on
your laptop or your computer,

40
00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.816
you're way better to just learn
how to do Python there, and

41
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:25.550
then paste the code into
the autograders later.

42
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.960
But if you have no access whatsoever,

43
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.240
that's why we give you
the Python Playground.

44
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.609
If you want to do this in Python 2,
because the course has taught in Python 3,

45
00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.660
there's a little button down here
that says switch to Python 2.

46
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.520
And so,
you can run Python 2 code in here as well.

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.440
You know Python 2, and the first ten weeks
of the class, you can actually switch

48
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.600
back and forth between submitting your
assignments in Python 3 and Python 2.

49
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.129
But in this case, now, the other thing
that's cool about this, is that you're not

50
00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.979
going to see this button, you're not
going to see any of those buttons.

51
00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.298
This views student code allows our
teaching staff to take a look at your

52
00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:04.190
code, and so we don't allow you
to paste code into the forums.

53
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.455
So what you can do is you can ask for
help in the forums, and

54
00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:10.670
the teaching staff can go in and
view the student code.

55
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.540
Type in your name or email, and
then find the code that you last put in.

56
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.176
So you can put something in here,
and get some help on it.

57
00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:22.127
The teaching assistant can see your
entire code, they can run your code,

58
00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:24.240
they can do all kinds of things.

59
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.999
And so it's a great way to communicate
with the teaching assistant.

60
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.540
You sort of leave your
code in the playground.

61
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.070
You ask the teaching assistant, and
then they go take a look at your code, and

62
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.479
give you some answers.

63
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:41.719
When you're all done, you simply press
done, and we're back to week two.

64
00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.041
But like I said, I really would personally
prefer that you build the skills in

65
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:49.340
running Python on your
laptop as quick as possible.

66
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.090
But if that's not practical for

67
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.590
you, then that's why we have the Python
playground here in courses one and two.
