[MUSIC]

4
00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:39.524
When you're doing production design 
there is this idea

5
00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.840
that you need to be able to 
build prototypes.

6
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.220
Because one of the, in a way, 
important elements of that

7
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.030
discipline is being able to test the
things you do with people.

8
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.970
So, you know, you want to make a website,
you make the prototype, a

9
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.340
mockup of the website, you try it with
people, you see how they react.

10
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.220
And the same thing with physical devices,

11
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.760
but physicals means you need to 
learn about electronics.

12
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.850
So we had to create different classes
that would basically make

13
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.440
electronics approachable to people that
don't have a background in electronics.

14
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.110
They next to zero software 
development background.

15
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.770
So, what we did when I started 
teaching is that I

16
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.495
started to experiment with the tools that
were available on the market.

17
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:25.770
[COUGH] And then I realized 
there were a number

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.140
of shortcomings, like, every, designers
mostly like to use Macs.

19
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.320
Mac haven't had serial ports for ages.

20
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.250
They all have USB ports.

21
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.330
And still, you know, there are
professionals that have

22
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.920
their development tools that 
are released now in 2013

23
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.620
they still only have serial ports, which,
it's really weird, because I

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.380
haven't seen a serial port on, 
on a laptop for a long time.

25
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.820
And on desktops, sometimes don't 
even have them anymore.

26
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.490
So we had to make something that would run
on a Mac, that would be easier to

27
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.190
use, that would be cheaper than what was

28
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.460
available on the market back then 
which, you know.

29
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.060
And also we had this programming language
we sort of inherited from the MIT called

30
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.700
Processing, which was used to teach about
programming to artists and designers.

31
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.390
So we thought, well, you know, 
why don't we try to make

32
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.930
that run on a microcontroller, so that
was based on Java.

33
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.350
Microcontrollers tend to, they don't
like Java very, very much.

34
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.660
They prefer languages, it's easier to work
with languages like C++ or C.

35
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.380
So we did some experiments, 
then one student

36
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.025
of mine did a thesis on the [UNKNOWN].

37
00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:46.070
So different projects sort of 
followed and then we

38
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.970
ended up with the first 
version of Arduino which,

39
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.216
based on the work that this student
Hernando Barragan

40
00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:56.980
did on a project called Wiring, we
re-implemented it from scratch.

41
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.010
So we reused the APIs but we rewrote the
whole thing to be completely open source,

42
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.230
because we also wanted 
something that would be

43
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.560
easy for people to reproduce, 
to build upon.

44
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.220
So we wanted to remove the barriers, and
one of the things that we did is also

45
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.800
that, since at the time we haven't got, in
a way, a clue how we were

46
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.840
going to manufacture, 
we didn't want to set up

47
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.330
like a classic manufacturing 
company, or go to a

48
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.210
venture capitalist or something 
because obviously there was,

49
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.820
back then nobody would have 
even talked to us.

50
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.280
So we thought, you know, let's release the
hardware as open source so that

51
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.750
people can build it if they want to.

52
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.000
And they started to make, we just started
to make the PCBs of the sort of two-hole

53
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.530
version and, and so we, we would just
give them away to people as a gift.

54
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.240
So, just take this PCB, assemble one.

55
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.000
And some people started to assemble it.
So they went on the website,

56
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.030
they got the instructions, 
they started to write.

57
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.410
That's to, to download the code, 
to solder the, the boards.

58
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.540
And so we got some feedback and we started
to build up a little bit of an audience.

59
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.460
And, and, you know, that's, that's 
how we started.

60
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.190
>> So, so, talk a little bit about the

61
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.780
the transition from people coming in to
the four-week class and

62
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.210
spending the first three days soldering

63
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.995
to the, to the sort of scaled-up
manufacture.

64
00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:16.710
>> [LAUGH].

65
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.100
>> I mean, what happened?

66
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.160
How, how did you get pushed?

67
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.685
What triggered the

68
00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:24.600
>> Well, we started to do 
introductory workshops

69
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.450
for people outside of the school.

70
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.500
I originally started this project with a
friend of mine called Avit Quartinas

71
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.020
who teaches in Sweden, and the two of us
both had similar issues

72
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.280
with our students. We wanted to, you know,
there was a bunch of input that

73
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.900
we gathered and so we started to make the
first of the two-hole versions.

74
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.250
Then we met an engineer that was 
living and working

75
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.750
in Ivrea that had experience in
manufacturing stuff.

76
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.710
He was actually helping me a lot when,

77
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.690
whenever the school wanted to manufacture
something with electronics.

78
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.660
I would ask this, Gianluca Martino 
is his name,

79
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.280
I would ask Gianluca to help me do that.

80
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.730
So I said, well, you know, can we
manufacture 200 of these pre-made?

81
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.880
That we can just, you know, 
sell to people? 

82
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.080
And then me and David managed 
to convince both Ivrea

83
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.540
and the school in Marma to
buy 50 each.

84
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.547
So 100 were sold and then we said, you know,
let's see if we can sell the other 100.

85
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.630
You know, who cares?

86
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600
>> What, on a website or something?

87
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.600
>> Well, we started to actually sell them
like this, like in this, by hand,

88
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.150
by sort of really like saying okay,

89
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.100
I'm going to run a workshop 
in this place, I need 20 boards

90
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.250
and we would just sell them to
people at the moment.

91
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.470
The platform was unknown, it was not

92
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.610
really proven, we were 
at the beginning.

93
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.240
Luckily we did some public 
demonstrations of how

94
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.650
you can do with this, 
and people understood.

95
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.750
So some people in different communities
started to put out the

96
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.167
word that there was this Arduino thing
that was very promising.

97
00:05:57.167 --> 00:06:01.570
So we got people. We organized a
workshop at the end of 2005 in London,

98
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.760
which was the first workshop where really
we put an ad and people paid and came.

99
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.460
I think there were a number of events
that lined up

100
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.000
that created, kind of fueled, this kind
of viral aspect.

101
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.200
So, obviously, first of all, we had a
friend that was teaching

102
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.350
these kind of topics in the U.S. 
at NYU in a school called ITP.

103
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.800
And he had a much bigger 
number of students.

104
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.490
He had something like 120 students.

105
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.920
And so, we met him one summer 
in Italy, doing

106
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.773
a work, a project together and we
showed him Arduino, 

107
00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:38.300
he started to play with it, he thought,

108
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.960
okay, I like this. We can go 
somewhere with this thing.

109
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.788
So he brought back a few prototypes, we
shipped him a few more boards.

110
00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:48.900
And he started to use it with some of the
second-year students.

111
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.510
And then at some point in 2006, I think, the
platform started to work properly.

112
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.570
You could do good projects with it.

113
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.591
And so the first-year students they saw
what the second-year students

114
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:03.540
were doing and they said well you know we
want that Arduino ourselves.

115
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.790
So I would say that generated, that kind of
gave us 120 power users.

116
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.560
People who make beautiful projects 
and designers

117
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.220
of these features, that tend to take

118
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.310
their projects and document 
them very nicely

119
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.150
put them online because 
it's their portfolio.

120
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.990
Well with Arduino the idea is that you
download a file, you plug

121
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.180
the board, okay back in the days you had
to install a few drivers.

122
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.420
But then, you know, in the space of a hour
or something you were working.

123
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.210
>> You got a blinking LED.

124
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.270
>> Yeah, the blinking LED was
the hello world.

125
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.390
The blinking LED is the hello world 
of physical computing.

126
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.170
So yeah, I think this viral aspect also
coupled with the fact that

127
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.620
we asked SparkFun Electronics, 
their online store

128
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.550
was again beginning to become 
very successful.

129
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.390
So we asked Nathan to carry Arduino,

130
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.840
you know, and he sort of graciously 
accepted to do that.

131
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.580
And so we, he kind of fueled our 
growth in the U.S. Then

132
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.830
me and David Cuartielles spent 
many, a number of years

133
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.760
traveling around the world, but mostly in
Europe at the beginning, doing workshops.

134
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.090
And we, you know, sometimes for free.

135
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.240
You know, just going somewhere and, you
know, sleeping in a

136
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.980
>> Couch
>> Whatever we could sleep.

137
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.370
Yeah, and then run workshops and that

138
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.570
obviously kind of fueled 
that kind of aspect.

139
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.770
But then it was a lot of people making
projects, documenting them,

140
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.680
putting them online and then sharing

141
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.410
information about how they 
built the product.

142
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.560
>> Where do you think this thing is
going to go and what, what, what

143
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.916
are your, some of your dreams of how it
could sort of change our world

144
00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:54.543
>> [LAUGH]
>> in powerful ways?.

145
00:08:54.543 --> 00:09:00.340
>> Well, in a way I think there's a 
wider, wider discussion

146
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.680
about empowering people to be 
creative with technology.

147
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.930
So because obviously nowadays 
the world that's around us

148
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.740
is made a lot of digital technology.

149
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:19.193
And there is an, there is a trend that I'm
not particularly happy with

150
00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:24.860
where people just buy devices and they
just use the devices, but they are not

151
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:31.280
aware of how you program, how you design,
you build things with the device.

152
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:38.850
So, you know, for me the iPad sometimes is
the TV set of the 21st Century, you know.

153
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.070
Obviously at home I have an iPad 
and I use it for a TV, because

154
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.700
you're browsing the Web, you're

155
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.430
watching TV, you're maybe
listening to music.

156
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.280
Yeah, you can create with the iPad with
certain applications, but it's

157
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.360
not something's that kind of makes you
want to program the device to do more.

158
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.460
And, and I think it's important,
especially for kids to, for them to

159
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.550
understand that the world we live in,
now especially if you look at

160
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:12.000
this room, this is a building that was
made, designed by human beings, built

161
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.240
by human beings, every single bit was
designed and built by a human being.

162
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.060
So clearly, if you know how to design and

163
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.830
build things, you can affect the world
that's around you.

164
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:30.090
If you are not able to participate in this,
in the world of creation

165
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.330
in the digital space, you're left out.

166
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.360
Somebody else is going to 
design your world.

167
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:43.000
At some point, you know, if there's no
innovation, if there is no sort

168
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.780
of renovation, in a way, inside the
marketplace, then one company

169
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.440
decides that that's the way you do a
certain thing, and that becomes

170
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.410
the only answer to a certain question and
nobody starts to debate that.

171
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:04.585
Or, you know in a way I think it's
important to be masters of the technology.
