00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.730
Hello, this is Dr. Chuck here and
I'm coming to you right now

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.100
in the continuing saga of
Internet History Technology and Security.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.930
I'm coming to you right now from Seoul,
Korea, and

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.030
we are having office hours here in Seoul,
Korea.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.090
And I'd like you to meet some
of your fellow students.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.020
>> Hello, my name is Nikolay Ketchoff,
I am from Russia but

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.340
I am working here in Korea for
LG Electronics.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.450
And I took this Internet History and
Security class, and

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.070
they are this vicious certificate.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.060
Actually it was my first online class,
and I really enjoyed it,

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.470
because it involved me in this
community of online courses.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.120
And Dr.
Chuck was really inspiring person for me,

13
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.220
and it really helped me to realize
how these online courses worked.

14
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.290
And also learn basic knowledge
in fun way about the Internet.

15
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.980
I think this course was really great,
and these online spirit courses

16
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.170
about to learn not to get,
not to be stressed by grades.

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.136
And what I just want to
add more to this course,

18
00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:19.140
kind of recommendation to add
more learning activities.

19
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.980
Maybe some kind of online games based on
this material, or something like that.

20
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.025
Actually, what I also
enjoy in the Internet,

21
00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:34.610
I learn, I watch TED very often.

22
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.780
And recently I watched this
talk from Shimon Schocken.

23
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.933
So he also talked about self-education,
self-learning, and

24
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:49.170
about his online courses, and
that I got idea about online games.

25
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.270
For learning, so
have fun and learn online.

26
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.278
>> Did you mention what
your degrees were in?

27
00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:59.010
>> I had two master degrees,
one in Computer Science in Russia and

28
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.490
one in Electrical Engineering in Korea.

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.100
>> Good, thank you.

30
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.310
>> Yeah, thank you very much for
this class.

31
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.110
>> What's your name?

32
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690
>> My name is Julie.

33
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.665
And I'm from Korea, so this is actually
my first course that I got certificate,

34
00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:17.820
and I am going to study
computer science for next year.

35
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.830
So this course is perfect for
me because it's free, but

36
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.140
also it gives a me, kind of more
hands up on a computer network.

37
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.748
And I will continue to study
about computer science and

38
00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:34.230
I'm actually pretty much interested
in computer network as well.

39
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.380
Well, I have a degree in physics and
biology, but

40
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.360
I got pretty much more interested in
computer science and programming.

41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.658
So, thank you for this whole lecture and

42
00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:50.423
I hope you enjoy every lectures of Dr.
Chuck in Coursera.

43
00:02:50.423 --> 00:02:51.030
>> Thank you.

44
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.540
>> Thank you.

45
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.060
>> Hi, my name is Choongil Kim.

46
00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.640
And I'm actually from Chicago and
I'm working in Korea right now.

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.234
I really enjoyed the course, well actually
my background is different from computer

48
00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:09.210
science, I'm an aerospace background,
but worked in the IT industry.

49
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.090
So this was the first Internet or any
type of computer science course I took.

50
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.750
And I really enjoyed it and I actually
enjoyed the history part of it a lot.

51
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.830
So thank you very much and we're looking
forward to see next class from Dr. Chuck.

52
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.160
>> You failed to mention where
you got your degrees from.

53
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.390
>> Oh yeah, code blue.

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.440
>> Tell us where you
got your degrees from.

55
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.230
>> I got my degree from
University of Michigan,

56
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.370
the best school in the world, where Dr.
Chuck's also a professor at.

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.740
And airspace engineering, so.

58
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.010
>> And was that masters, PhD?

59
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.810
>> Masters and PhD, and
even post-doctorate.

60
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.100
>> Julie, Julie,
where did you get your degree at?

61
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.860
>> I got my degree in South Korea,
Dong Uk University.

62
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.760
>> Okay.
>> Yeah,

63
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.280
and well I'm going to Virginia
to study computer science.

64
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.930
>> Great, so
are you gonna actually go to Virginia and

65
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.440
>> This December, yeah.

66
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.770
>> And so you're preparing in a sense
to sort of spend some time in Virginia.

67
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.040
>> Yep.
>> Work on your master's degree.

68
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.030
>> Yep.

69
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.980
That's right.
>> Outstanding.

70
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.540
Okay, back to me.

71
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.040
Flip.

72
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.560
So there you have it.

73
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.080
Zoom out a little bit, zoom out.

74
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.980
So there you have it.

75
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.880
Here we have wonderful office
hours here in Seoul, Korea and

76
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.590
now we're gonna go all take some
pictures so see you on the Net.
